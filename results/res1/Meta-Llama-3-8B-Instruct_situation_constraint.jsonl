If no such elements are found, the function returns an empty list and `None` for the median and mean.\n\nThen, it sorts `filtered_list` in ascending order. If the length of `filtered_list` is odd, the median is the middle element. If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\nFinally, it calculates the mean by summing all elements in `filtered_list` and dividing by its length."}

Take notes, annotate, and engage with the material by asking questions like \"What is the author trying to say?\", \"What are the implications of this argument?\", and \"What are the potential counterarguments?\"\n2. **Practice active listening**: In debates, you'll need to listen carefully to your opponent's arguments and respond effectively. Practice active listening by paying attention to the speaker's words, tone, and body language. Try to identify the main points they're making and think about how you can respond to them.\n3. **Develop your analytical skills**: Philosophy is all about analyzing complex ideas and arguments. Practice breaking down complex concepts into smaller parts, identifying key terms and definitions, and evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of an argument.\n4. **Think critically about assumptions**: In debates, your opponent will likely make assumptions about the topic or the audience.

Can you guide me on how to wrap the present neatly to ensure it looks both attractive and thoughtful? Make sure your response carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.assistant\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to wrap a book gift nicely for a themed surprise birthday party:\n\n**Materials needed:**\n\n* Gift wrapping paper (choose a design that matches the party theme)\n* Gift wrapping tape\n* Ribbon or gift tag\n* Scissors\n* Gift box (optional)\n\n**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n\n1. **Measure the book:** Measure the book's dimensions to ensure you have enough wrapping paper. You can use a gift wrapping paper that's slightly larger than the book to create a neat and tidy wrap.\n2. **Cut the wrapping paper:** Cut the wrapping paper to the desired size, leaving a little extra on each side for folding and taping.\n3. **Place the book on the paper:** Position the book in the center of the wrapping paper, ensuring it's aligned with the paper's edges.\n4. **Fold and crease the paper:** Fold one edge of the paper over the book, creating a crisp crease. Repeat this process with the other edges, making sure to crease each fold.\n5. **Tuck and fold:** Tuck the folded edges under the book, creating a neat and tidy wrap. You can use a bone folder or a similar tool to create a sharp crease.\n6. **Secure with tape:** Apply gift wrapping tape to the seams, making sure to press the tape firmly to create a clean finish.\n7. **Add a ribbon or gift tag:** Tie a ribbon around the book or attach a gift tag with a personalized message. This adds a thoughtful touch and completes the gift wrapping.\n8. **Optional: Add a gift box:** If you want to make the gift even more special, consider placing the wrapped book in a gift box. This adds an extra layer of protection and makes the gift more presentable.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use a gift wrapping paper with a design that matches the party theme to make the gift more cohesive.\n* Consider adding a small gift card or bookmark to the wrapping paper for a personal touch.\n* If you're using a gift box, you can wrap the book in a smaller piece of paper or tissue paper before placing it in the box.\n* To add some extra flair, you can tie a small gift or a themed item (e.g., a bookmark with a charm) to the ribbon or gift tag.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll create a beautifully wrapped book gift that's both attractive and thoughtful. Your friend will appreciate the effort you put into making the gift special, and it will be a memorable addition to their birthday celebration."}

If it is, it updates the balance and returns a message with the new balance. If the amount is not positive, it returns an error message.\n\nYou can add more methods to the BankAccount class to implement other features, such as withdrawing money, checking the balance, or transferring funds between accounts."}

New balance: $1200\nprint(account.get_balance())  # Output: Account balance: $1200\n```\n\nThis code defines a `BankAccount` class with methods for depositing and withdrawing funds, as well as retrieving the current balance. The `deposit` method adds the specified amount to the balance, the `withdraw` method subtracts the specified amount from the balance if it's not greater than the current balance, and the `get_balance` method returns the current balance."}

New balance: $1326.00\n\n# Get the current balance\nprint(savings_account.get_balance())  # Output: 1326.0\n```\n\nThis implementation provides the basic features you requested, including deposit, withdrawal, and interest application.

It also initializes the `data_` vector with zeros using the `resize` method.\n* The `getRows()` and `getCols()` methods return the number of rows and columns, respectively.\n* The `get()` method returns the value of the element at row `i` and column `j`.\n* The `set()` method sets the value of the element at row `i` and column `j`.\n\nNote that this implementation does not include any error checking or handling, such as checking if the row and column indices are within the valid range. You may want to add additional methods or checks to handle such cases."}
