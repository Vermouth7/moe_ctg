Ally's fear:\nThe correct answer is \"Ally was awakened by a noise at night and was afraid.\" The fact that it was midnight and Ally's brother was walking to the kitchen for a snack suggests that it's more likely that Ally was awakened by a noise at night, which would be more frightening to her due to her fear of ghosts.\n2. Johnny's baseball skills:\nThe correct answer is \"he decided to practice more.\" The fact that Johnny was a terrible baseball player and lost the game for his team suggests that he might want to improve his skills, rather than giving up.\n3. Ray's coins:\nThe correct answer is \"He found the coin machine and went to work.\" The fact that the teller handed Ray $50 in cash suggests that Ray had a large amount of loose change, which is likely to be the result of collecting coins from a coin machine.\n4.

Johnny's baseball:\nThe correct answer is \"he decided to practice more.\" The fact that Johnny was a terrible baseball player and lost his team the game suggests that he might be motivated to improve his skills. Giving up would be an unlikely response to a disappointing performance.\n\n3. Ray's coin machine:\nThe correct answer is \"He found the coin machine and went to work.\" The description states that Ray took a big sack of loose change to the bank to cash in, and the teller handed him $50 in cash. This implies that Ray was trying to deposit his loose change, not trying to cash it in.\n\n4.

Instead, it implies he needs to improve, so he decides to practice more.\n\n3. Ray's experience at the bank:\nThe correct answer is indeed \"He found the coin machine and went to work.\" The description states Ray took a big sack of loose change to the bank, and the teller handed him $50 in cash.

Samantha's TV purchase:\nThe correct answer is indeed \"Samantha took out a loan for a TV.\" The description states Samantha wanted a brand-new TV, but ended up with crippling debt for years.

With the current price difference I was even hesitant to contact you but I was hoping that you might have some wiggle room. \n\nI am open to hearing offers.\n\nI wish I could, but I just can't get over $1600.\n\nOh wow that is really low. if you can come up to 2500 it is yours. This is a very popular area and a great vacation rental.\n\nI agree, and it is gorgeous! If I could get up there I would. Unfortunately my hands are so very tied! What about a trade for work?

It comes with a refrigerator, dishwasher and garbage disposal. I have it up for $1800.\n\nOh, that sounds pretty good but that is a bit high for me.  Do you have anything less expensive?\n\nWell the price is slightly higher because it is in a great location where everything is nearby such as shopping centers and schools. I can go slightly lower than $1800. How is $1500?\n\nWell it does seem convenient to be close to shopping.  Do I have to maintain my own yard or is that included? \n\nThat is included.

{"prompt_new": "Context: On 21 September, 2015, Canadians Robert Hall and John Ridsdel, as well as Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad, and  Marites Flor; a Filipino woman, were abducted on Samai island near Davao. Ridsdel was beheaded by Abu Sayyaf on 25 April 2016 following a ransom deadline. ASG reportedly demanded more than $8.1 million for Ridsdel and the others. On 3 May, 2016, a video of the Ridsdel execution was released, along with new demands for the remaining hostages. A masked captor said, \"Note to the Philippine government and to the Canadian government: The lesson is clear. John Ridsdel has been beheaded. Now there are three remaining captives here. If you procrastinate once again the negotiations, we will behead this all anytime\". On 15 May, Hall  appeared in a new video, announcing that he and Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad would be decapitated at 3pm on Monday 13 June absent a ransom of $16 million. Both hostages wore orange coveralls, similar to hostages in videos produced by ISIL, to which Abu Sayyaf had previously pledged allegiance. The deadline passed. Hall was beheaded. On 24 June, Abu Sayyaf released Filipina Marites Flor. She was subsequently flown to Davao to meet President-elect Rodrigo Duterte. Duterte said he directed negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf. He did not elaborate. On 17 September, 2016, remaining hostage Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad was released on Jolo island. Abu Ramie, an ASG spokesman, claimed $638,000 was paid as ransom.\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question from the above context.

While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan, the number of Chinese released was only 56. At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia Development Board, or K\u014dain, for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10 million. In Java, between 4 and 10 million r\u014dmusha , were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question from the above context.

After both teams initial possession ended in punts, the Patriots drove to the Ravens 19 before settling for a Gostkowski field goal. On the first play of the Ravens' next drive, Steve Gregory intercepted Joe Flacco at the 42 and returned it 36 yards to the Ravens 6-yard line. Three plays later Brandon Bolden ran in a 2-yard touchdown, extending the lead to 10-0. Following another Ravens punt, the Patriots may have missed a chance to put the game away. After driving to the Ravens 27, an offensive pass interference penalty on Rob Gronkowski moved the ball to the Ravens 30. Then, a 19-yard reception on 2-and-11 was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty moved the ball back to the Ravens 40, eventually ending in a 49-yard Gostkowski field goal, keeping the Ravens in the game. This time the Ravens finally managed a response driving 80 yards to score to score on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Torrey Smith, trimming the score to 13-7. On the drive, Jerod Mayo was called for pass interference on 3rd-and-6 and Flacco completed a 14-yard pass on 3rd-and-13. Following a Patriots punt, the Ravens marched 92 yards in over 6 minutes to take a 14-13 lead on a 20-yard touchdown reception by Dennis Pitta. The Patriots took the lead right back marching 81 yards and never faced a third-down, taking the lead on a 7-yard touchdown reception by Edelman for a 20-14 halftime lead. In the second half the Ravens took the opening drive 80 yards and scored on a 7-yard touchdown run by Ray Rice to allow Baltimore to retake a 21-20 lead. Again the Patriots took the lead right back on a 12 play, 78-yard march to take a 27-21 lead on a 3-yard touchdown run by Danny Woodhead.

The Ravens defense allowed Beckham two 60+ yard touchdowns, helping the Giants win.\nQuestion: How many losing streaks of 3+ games did the Ravens experience on the year?\nAnswer:\n{'response': '2'}\n\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question, \"How many prisoners all together were released after the  surrender of Japan?\" I found the following text-snippet has the answer. Can you tell me the answer?\n\nJapanese prisoner-of-war camps, many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27.1 per cent , seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians. While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan, the number of Chinese released was only 56. At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia Development Board, or K\u014dain, for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10 million. In Java, between 4 and 10 million r\u014dmusha , were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.\nThe response of the bot is: 80556\n\nContext:  The Patriots were hoping to stave off a losing streak and rebound from their loss to the Cardinals in this rematch of the AFC Championship. After both teams initial possession ended in punts, the Patriots drove to the Ravens 19 before settling for a Gostkowski field goal. On the first play of the Ravens' next drive, Steve Gregory intercepted Joe Flacco at the 42 and returned it 36 yards to the Ravens 6-yard line. Three plays later Brandon Bolden ran in a 2-yard touchdown, extending the lead to 10-0. Following another Ravens punt, the Patriots may have missed a chance to put the game away. After driving to the Ravens 27, an offensive pass interference penalty on Rob Gronkowski moved the ball to the Ravens 30. Then, a 19-yard reception on 2-and-11 was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty moved the ball back to the Ravens 40, eventually ending in a 49-yard Gostkowski field goal, keeping the Ravens in the game. This time the Ravens finally managed a response driving 80 yards to score to score on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Torrey Smith, trimming the score to 13-7. On the drive, Jerod Mayo was called for pass interference on 3rd-and-6 and Flacco completed a 14-yard pass on 3rd-and-13. Following a Patriots punt, the Ravens marched 92 yards in over 6 minutes to take a 14-13 lead on a 20-yard touchdown reception by Dennis Pitta. The Patriots took the lead right back marching 81 yards and never faced a third-down, taking the lead on a 7-yard touchdown reception by Edelman for a 20-14 halftime lead. In the second half the Ravens took the opening drive 80 yards and scored on a 7-yard touchdown run by Ray Rice to allow Baltimore to retake a 21-20 lead. Again the Patriots took the lead right back on a 12 play, 78-yard march to take a 27-21 lead on a 3-yard touchdown run by Danny Woodhead. Following a Ravens punt the Patriots drove all the way to the Ravens 2-yard line, but had to settle for a 20-yard field goal, making the score 30-21 early in the fourth quarter. The Ravens proceeded to drive...\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question from the above context.  Can you tell me the answer?\nQuestion: How many points did the Ravens win by?\nAnswer:\nAI assistant: 1\n\nQuestion: Who did Vlad \u0162epe\u015f want mobilized?\nAnswer based on following passage.\n\nVlad \u0162epe\u015f asked the Hungarian king for assistance.  He received no support despite promises made by Corvinus and instead called for a mobilization that included \"not only men of military age, but also of women and of children from the age of twelve up; and included Gypsy slave contingents.\" Various sources mention the strength of his army to be between 22,000 and 30,900, with the most popular accepted number set at 30,000. The letter of Leonardo Tocco which put the numbers of the Turkish army at an exaggerated strength of 400,000, exaggerated also the Wallachian strength which was estimated at 200,000. The majority of the army consisted of peasants and shepherds, while the boyars on horseback\u2014who were few in numbers\u2014were armed with lances, swords, and daggers and wore chainmail as armour. Vlad's personal guard consisted of mercenaries from many countries and some Gypsies. Before battle, it is believed that Vlad told his men that \"it would be better that those who think of death should not follow me\".\n\nAnswer:\nBot: men of military age, women and of children, Gypsy slave contingents\n\nContext: Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Packers, the Vikings played their Week 2 home opener against the Indianapolis Colts. In the first half, kicker Ryan Longwell helped Minnesota take the early lead with a 45-yard and a 27-yard field goal in the first quarter, along with a 53-yard field goal in the second quarter. In the third quarter, the Vikes increased its lead with Longwell getting a 46-yard and a 28-yard field goal. However, the Colts responded with RB Joseph Addai getting a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, Indianapolis continued to gain ground as QB Peyton Manning completed a 32-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne, followed by a two-point conversion run by RB Dominic Rhodes. Later, the Colts sealed the win with kicker Adam Vinatieri nailing the game-winning 47-yard field goal.\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question from the above context.  Can you tell me the answer?\nQuestion: How many field goals did Ryan Longwell kick?\nAnswer:", "result": "The question you're asking is \"What happened first, a video of the Ridsdel execution being released or the release of Kjartan Sekkingstad?\"\n\nAccording to the passage, a video of the Ridsdel execution was released on May 3, 2016, and Kjartan Sekkingstad was released on September 17, 2016. Therefore, the video of the Ridsdel execution was released before Sekkingstad was released.\n\nAnswer: A video of the Ridsdel execution being released"}

{"prompt_new": "Tell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: More Than 22% of Heart-Device Implantations Aren\u2019t In Line With Guidelines\n\nPassage: The story deserves high marks for bringing costs into the discussion right in the lead. \u201cIn more than 22% of cases, implantable defibrillators are given to heart patients who don\u2019t meet the guidelines for receiving the pricey devices, according to a study just published in JAMA.\u201d The story also says, \u201cICDs, which can cost north of $30,000, monitor the rhythm of the heart and produce a shock to bring irregular beating back to normal.\u201d But just as with the Times story, the cost of the device and hospitalizations is only a piece of the economic picture. Additional costs of maintaining the device and battery replacement drive the costs higher. In reality however the overall economic impact of the devices is just about the same as treatment of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol when life years (a commonly applied economic marker) is considered. As with the harms, the benefits are not quantified. The story says up high that patients who fell outside the guidelines had a \u201chigher risk of dying in the hospital and of complications from the implantation.\u201d But there are no numbers provided. In fact, there are more percentages provided in this story about the stock prices of the various device makers involved than there are about the harms or benefits. This is the Wall Street Journal, of course, but we still thought some additional numbers about harms or benefits would have been helpful to any reader. The story attempts to evaluate the quality of the evidence, but it falls short. In comparing the way this story brings context to the shocking findings to the way the LA Times does, this story is confusing and potentially misleading. We have read these paragraphs several times and still are not sure what they mean: Did these patients attempt to sign up for clinical trials and were denied? And what is the bill that the 22.5% will not fit? The LA Times story examines the study in much clearer language and provides the right context. The story does not engage in disease-mongering. We spent some time on the fence...\nThe response of the bot is: likely false\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Pill Treats Painful Fibroids\n\nPassage: The story does not describe costs of the drug. The story states that 80 to 95% of women have no bleeding after taking the drug. However, that leaves a lot of open questions about the effectiveness of the drug. For example, how long does this benefit last? What about other symptoms of fibroids like abdominal pain and pressure? The story repeatedly mentions that the drug shrinks fibroids. By how much? Is that difference clinically meaningful? In other words, can women perceive an improvement in bulk symptoms\u00a0(pain, pressure) as a result of the decreased fibroid size? Do the fibroids grow back? The story mentions the potential harm of elevated liver function test results. However, it does not explain\u00a0 that women commonly experience abdominal pain, headaches and nausea with this drug. The story does not critically appraise the current study. This was a small study (57 patients) with a short follow-up time. The results have also yet to be fully evaluated and have only been presented at a scientific conference. The story verges on disease mongering by exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids. While it is true that up to 80% of women may have fibroids, only about 20% of women will have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they would seek treatment. Fibroids in of themselves are benign and are not problematic unless they cause symptoms and treatment should only be initiated if a woman is bothered by them. Symptoms of fibroids also most often go away after menopause. However, this story leaves the impression that all women with fibroids should be treated. The story quoted multiple independent experts. The story mentions Lupron and Uterine Artery Embolization as alternatives to EllaOne but fails to mention many other safe and effective options that are currently available. For example, oral contraceptives (which are not approved for fibroids but are commonly used for that indication) can help reduce bleeding and cramping associated with fibroids. Likewise, the Mirena IUD often stops bleeding altogether. NSAIDs can...\nThe response of the bot is: definitely false\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Heart Failure Drug Shows Promise in First Human Trial\n\nPassage: There is no mention of the cost for the tested drug, cimaglermin, in this story. The costs for regularly prescribed drugs for the medical condition that\u2019s the focus of the study \u2014 weakened left ventricular function \u2014 are well known and although cimaglermin is an experimental drug, it should be possible to predict whether the new drug would be comparatively priced, cheaper or more expensive. Readers would benefit from that knowledge. While this story discusses that the drug seemed to benefit patients and was effective, it doesn\u2019t say how that was measured, and by how much the measurement improved due to the drug.

It would have been helpful to readers to discuss the approximate cost of a massage session, which can vary widely depending on the region, therapist and setting. The Center for Spirituality & Healing at the University of Minnesota estimates the national average for an hour-long massage to be about $60. Many people may wonder if their insurance policy would cover a massage therapy session. Insurance companies rarely pay for massage therapy, particularly for indications that aren\u2019t backed by science or evidence. The news release cited three studies, but descriptions of the research were too vague to be helpful. Readers aren\u2019t given any benefit data or any quantitative estimate on how well massage therapy actually works. We don\u2019t know how many participants were in each trial and who actually benefited from massage therapy. The release alludes to the fact several times that the immune system became stronger, but how was this measured? There are also non-specific references to the benefits of massage therapy, such as increasing the activity of white blood cells and reducing anxiety levels, but again, we don\u2019t know who actually benefited and by how much. When we looked at the studies cited we were surprised to find that none of them related to massage therapy for reducing rates of the \u201ccommon cold, flu and other seasonal illnesses,\u201d as claimed in the release. The first study was from 2010 and is described by its authors as \u201cpreliminary\u201d work that looks at a \u201csingle-session comparison of Swedish Massage Therapy with a light touch control condition\u201d measuring \u00a0\u201cOxytocin (OT), arginine-vasopressin (AVP), adrenal corticotropin hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT), circulating phenotypic lymphocytes markers, and mitogen-stimulated cytokine production.\u201d\u00a0 This study is far removed from patient-oriented, or even disease-oriented outcomes, and has nothing to do with their sweeping comments that massage may fend off flu and the common cold. The second study (from 2001)...", "result": "Please provide the claims you'd like me to evaluate, and I'll respond with the corresponding assessment:\n\n1.

{"prompt_new": "Tell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: More Than 22% of Heart-Device Implantations Aren\u2019t In Line With Guidelines\n\nPassage: The story deserves high marks for bringing costs into the discussion right in the lead. \u201cIn more than 22% of cases, implantable defibrillators are given to heart patients who don\u2019t meet the guidelines for receiving the pricey devices, according to a study just published in JAMA.\u201d The story also says, \u201cICDs, which can cost north of $30,000, monitor the rhythm of the heart and produce a shock to bring irregular beating back to normal.\u201d But just as with the Times story, the cost of the device and hospitalizations is only a piece of the economic picture. Additional costs of maintaining the device and battery replacement drive the costs higher. In reality however the overall economic impact of the devices is just about the same as treatment of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol when life years (a commonly applied economic marker) is considered. As with the harms, the benefits are not quantified. The story says up high that patients who fell outside the guidelines had a \u201chigher risk of dying in the hospital and of complications from the implantation.\u201d But there are no numbers provided. In fact, there are more percentages provided in this story about the stock prices of the various device makers involved than there are about the harms or benefits. This is the Wall Street Journal, of course, but we still thought some additional numbers about harms or benefits would have been helpful to any reader. The story attempts to evaluate the quality of the evidence, but it falls short. In comparing the way this story brings context to the shocking findings to the way the LA Times does, this story is confusing and potentially misleading. We have read these paragraphs several times and still are not sure what they mean: Did these patients attempt to sign up for clinical trials and were denied? And what is the bill that the 22.5% will not fit? The LA Times story examines the study in much clearer language and provides the right context. The story does not engage in disease-mongering. We spent some time on the fence...\nThe response of the bot is: likely false\n\nAfter reading:\n\n The story does not describe costs of the drug. The story states that 80 to 95% of women have no bleeding after taking the drug. However, that leaves a lot of open questions about the effectiveness of the drug. For example, how long does this benefit last? What about other symptoms of fibroids like abdominal pain and pressure? The story repeatedly mentions that the drug shrinks fibroids. By how much? Is that difference clinically meaningful? In other words, can women perceive an improvement in bulk symptoms\u00a0(pain, pressure) as a result of the decreased fibroid size? Do the fibroids grow back? The story mentions the potential harm of elevated liver function test results. However, it does not explain\u00a0 that women commonly experience abdominal pain, headaches and nausea with this drug. The story does not critically appraise the current study. This was a small study (57 patients) with a short follow-up time. The results have also yet to be fully evaluated and have only been presented at a scientific conference. The story verges on disease mongering by exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids. While it is true that up to 80% of women may have fibroids, only about 20% of women will have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they would seek treatment. Fibroids in of themselves are benign and are not problematic unless they cause symptoms and treatment should only be initiated if a woman is bothered by them. Symptoms of fibroids also most often go away after menopause. However, this story leaves the impression that all women with fibroids should be treated. The story quoted multiple independent experts. The story mentions Lupron and Uterine Artery Embolization as alternatives to EllaOne but fails to mention many other safe and effective options that are currently available. For example, oral contraceptives (which are not approved for fibroids but are commonly used for that indication) can help reduce bleeding and cramping associated with fibroids.

It would have been helpful to readers to discuss the approximate cost of a massage session, which can vary widely depending on the region, therapist and setting. The Center for Spirituality & Healing at the University of Minnesota estimates the national average for an hour-long massage to be about $60. Many people may wonder if their insurance policy would cover a massage therapy session. Insurance companies rarely pay for massage therapy, particularly for indications that aren\u2019t backed by science or evidence. The news release cited three studies, but descriptions of the research were too vague to be helpful. Readers aren\u2019t given any benefit data or any quantitative estimate on how well massage therapy actually works. We don\u2019t know how many participants were in each trial and who actually benefited from massage therapy. The release alludes to the fact several times that the immune system became stronger, but how was this measured? There are also non-specific references to the benefits of massage therapy, such as increasing the activity of white blood cells and reducing anxiety levels, but again, we don\u2019t know who actually benefited and by how much. When we looked at the studies cited we were surprised to find that none of them related to massage therapy for reducing rates of the \u201ccommon cold, flu and other seasonal illnesses,\u201d as claimed in the release. The first study was from 2010 and is described by its authors as \u201cpreliminary\u201d work that looks at a \u201csingle-session comparison of Swedish Massage Therapy with a light touch control condition\u201d measuring \u00a0\u201cOxytocin (OT), arginine-vasopressin (AVP), adrenal corticotropin hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT), circulating phenotypic lymphocytes markers, and mitogen-stimulated cytokine production.\u201d\u00a0 This study is far removed from patient-oriented, or even disease-oriented outcomes, and has nothing to do with their sweeping comments that massage may fend off flu and the common cold. The second study (from 2001)...", "result": "I believe the claim \"Massage Therapy May Boost Immune System to Combat Cold, Flu\" is:\n\n**Not Proven**\n\nThe passage highlights several issues with the news release, including:\n\n* Lack of specific data on the benefits of massage therapy\n* Unclear measurement of immune system strengthening\n* No evidence that massage therapy is effective in reducing rates of the common cold, flu, and other seasonal illnesses\n* The studies cited are unrelated to the claimed benefits\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence and is not proven."}
{"prompt_new": "After reading:\n\n The story deserves high marks for bringing costs into the discussion right in the lead. \u201cIn more than 22% of cases, implantable defibrillators are given to heart patients who don\u2019t meet the guidelines for receiving the pricey devices, according to a study just published in JAMA.\u201d The story also says, \u201cICDs, which can cost north of $30,000, monitor the rhythm of the heart and produce a shock to bring irregular beating back to normal.\u201d But just as with the Times story, the cost of the device and hospitalizations is only a piece of the economic picture. Additional costs of maintaining the device and battery replacement drive the costs higher. In reality however the overall economic impact of the devices is just about the same as treatment of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol when life years (a commonly applied economic marker) is considered. As with the harms, the benefits are not quantified. The story says up high that patients who fell outside the guidelines had a \u201chigher risk of dying in the hospital and of complications from the implantation.\u201d But there are no numbers provided. In fact, there are more percentages provided in this story about the stock prices of the various device makers involved than there are about the harms or benefits. This is the Wall Street Journal, of course, but we still thought some additional numbers about harms or benefits would have been helpful to any reader. The story attempts to evaluate the quality of the evidence, but it falls short. In comparing the way this story brings context to the shocking findings to the way the LA Times does, this story is confusing and potentially misleading.

The story states that 80 to 95% of women have no bleeding after taking the drug. However, that leaves a lot of open questions about the effectiveness of the drug. For example, how long does this benefit last? What about other symptoms of fibroids like abdominal pain and pressure? The story repeatedly mentions that the drug shrinks fibroids. By how much? Is that difference clinically meaningful? In other words, can women perceive an improvement in bulk symptoms\u00a0(pain, pressure) as a result of the decreased fibroid size? Do the fibroids grow back? The story mentions the potential harm of elevated liver function test results. However, it does not explain\u00a0 that women commonly experience abdominal pain, headaches and nausea with this drug. The story does not critically appraise the current study. This was a small study (57 patients) with a short follow-up time. The results have also yet to be fully evaluated and have only been presented at a scientific conference. The story verges on disease mongering by exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids. While it is true that up to 80% of women may have fibroids, only about 20% of women will have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they would seek treatment. Fibroids in of themselves are benign and are not problematic unless they cause symptoms and treatment should only be initiated if a woman is bothered by them. Symptoms of fibroids also most often go away after menopause. However, this story leaves the impression that all women with fibroids should be treated. The story quoted multiple independent experts. The story mentions Lupron and Uterine Artery Embolization as alternatives to EllaOne but fails to mention many other safe and effective options that are currently available. For example, oral contraceptives (which are not approved for fibroids but are commonly used for that indication) can help reduce bleeding and cramping associated with fibroids. Likewise, the Mirena IUD often stops bleeding altogether. NSAIDs can...\n\nbecause of:\n#Answer#\nFibroids are common and can cause bothersome symptoms such as pain, bleeding, and pressure in some women. However, they are also benign and deciding about how or whether to treatment them depends on how much a woman is bothered by her symptoms, feels about the pros and cons of different treatments, and whether she wishes to conserve her fertility. There are many different safe and viable treatments available, ranging from medications to minimally invasive procedures to surgery. Women who make a fully-informed decision about treatment in conjunction with their doctor are likely to be satisfied with their treatment so long as their choice matches their goals and what\u2019s important to them. Even with so many options, it would be welcome news that a drug may not just treat the symptoms but actually might reduce the size of fibroids. A new study presented at this week\u2019s European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology shows that EllaOne, currently available as an emergency contraceptive in Europe (but not in the US), may shrink fibroids and reduce symptoms relative to placebo. However, the results should be greeted cautiously. This was a small, short study and the full results have not been evaluated. More research is needed to confirm them and answer many outstanding questions. Whilet EllaOne may be shown to\u00a0 be very helpful to women with fibroids in the future, these results are\u00a0premature at best.\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Heart Failure Drug Shows Promise in First Human Trial\n\nPassage: There is no mention of the cost for the tested drug, cimaglermin, in this story. The costs for regularly prescribed drugs for the medical condition that\u2019s the focus of the study \u2014 weakened left ventricular function \u2014 are well known and although cimaglermin is an experimental drug, it should be possible to predict whether the new drug would be comparatively priced, cheaper or more expensive. Readers would benefit from that knowledge. While this story discusses that the drug seemed to benefit patients and was effective, it doesn\u2019t say how that was measured, and by how much the measurement improved due to the drug. (By digging into the research paper, via figure 3, we found that the benefits were measured by tracking absolute increases in\u00a0ejection fraction, which is the amount of blood pumped out the ventricles. It increased 8% in the group receiving a medium or high dose of the medicine.) One issue that might be confusing for readers: The story notes that a \u201cphase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, then why is the framing of the story about how effective it was? The story clearly points out that side effects included nausea and headaches, and that one participant did experience abnormal liver function after receiving the highest dose, a side effect that eventually cleared up. This is a strong point of the story: It clearly establishes that this was a small phase one randomized controlled trial, and the story explains what that means for the drug\u2019s development. A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The process can take several years. Based on these preliminary findings, larger trials are being planned, Lenihan said.

The story explained that the devices \"\"can cost as much as $30,000.\"\" And there was one data point from one study on one device that users\u2019 hospital costs were $1,600 less per admission. But the device costs are variable and device performance will be variable. We\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt but it painted the cost picture with really broad strokes. Information about the potential to increase longevity was presented from a study that has not yet been published. The information was presented as a relative increase rather than an absolute increase. The story didn\u2019t contain sufficient information to quantify the benefit to any specific group of patients. The story did mention the problem of potential information overload however there was no discussion of actual harm such as inappropriate shocks from implanted defibrillator devices, for example. There was no questioning of the accuracy of the data potentially transmitted by devices. This was a far too rosy picture \u2013 almost as if all the data was so terrific that the only downside could be the volume of terrific data. Other things can go wrong as past experience shows when you try to regulate the heart. In our eyes, a red flag went up when the story cited \"\"a paper under review.\"\" We don\u2019t know the quality of the paper nor have peer reviewers completed their review yet. So that\u2019s giving the researcher free rein to say whatever he wants about that study. We also must address the headline which stated \u2018New tools for helping heart patients\u2019 before we have concrete demonstration that the new tools actually do help. The story opened with an anecdote that implied that something terrible was avoided. That, of course, is always hard to know. The punch line is that without the device reporting in to a clinician, the situation was one in which it \u00a0\"\"could have gone for months before the problem was discovered.\"\" The story never considered the question of whether there is always value in immediate recognition of a situation.

There are also non-specific references to the benefits of massage therapy, such as increasing the activity of white blood cells and reducing anxiety levels, but again, we don\u2019t know who actually benefited and by how much. When we looked at the studies cited we were surprised to find that none of them related to massage therapy for reducing rates of the \u201ccommon cold, flu and other seasonal illnesses,\u201d as claimed in the release. The first study was from 2010 and is described by its authors as \u201cpreliminary\u201d work that looks at a \u201csingle-session comparison of Swedish Massage Therapy with a light touch control condition\u201d measuring \u00a0\u201cOxytocin (OT), arginine-vasopressin (AVP), adrenal corticotropin hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT), circulating phenotypic lymphocytes markers, and mitogen-stimulated cytokine production.\u201d\u00a0 This study is far removed from patient-oriented, or even disease-oriented outcomes, and has nothing to do with their sweeping comments that massage may fend off flu and the common cold. The second study (from 2001)...", "result": "The bot's responses are as follows:\n\n1. \"More Than 22% of Heart-Device Implantations Aren\u2019t In Line With Guidelines\" is definitely false.\n2. \"Pill Treats Painful Fibroids\" is definitely false.\n3. \"Heart Failure Drug Shows Promise in First Human Trial\" is likely false.\n4. \"New Tools for Helping Heart Patients\" is false.\n5. \"Seven presidents before (Barack Obama) -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans\" is definitely true.\n6. \"Massage Therapy May Boost Immune System to Combat Cold, Flu\" is likely false."}

It's the romance of an ex-alcoholic unemployed man who just came out of a big depression and a single middle-aged woman who works in an employment office (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of clich\u00e9s, taking the 'social' theme of the movie and turn it in to a romance comedy. The lead actor did a good job, he definitely looks like an alcoholic man, but Ana Belen is not believable as a working class woman, she looks, acts and talks very much like a 'high-standing' woman. What I mean is that Ana Belen plays herself. She does it in all her movies anyway. The whole mise-en-scene of the film was very poor. The photography is ugly, not using well at all the panoramic aspect ratio. The dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times. The comic situations are typical from Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly. In my opinion this film is not worth watching. Only if you really love Pereira's previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit. Anyway, I walked out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The film-maker was by the door.

I'm desperately unimpressed by stabs at its cinematography, directing or acting performances.<br /><br />Secondly, this wasn't Zuniga's first horror flick, it was her first screen appearance period, cinema, TV, whatever. For what it is worth; neither is Daphne Zuniga Susan Sarandon or Katherine Hepburn.<br /><br />Thirdly, you have to give even a lame slasher flick props. Sure, it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre: any young woman having or showing interest in sex is beef on the hoof, and the harvest time is now.<br /><br />Except this one gives the chop to the sweet, virginal protagonist as well! Now THERE is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its convictions! Interesting that this was said ingenue's only film role.

Only if you really love Pereira's previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit. Anyway, I walked out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The film-maker was by the door. I wonder what a director feels like when he sees someone walking out of one of his films, specially one that is made to please everybody. Did the reviewer find this movie good or bad?\nThe answer is: bad\n\n((NB: Spoiler warning, such as it is!))<br /><br />First off, this is a teen slasher flick -- the Spam-In-A-Cabin genre, as Joe Bob Briggs piquantly put it. If you're looking for Roshambo, this isn't it and wasn't going to BE it. I'm desperately unimpressed by stabs at its cinematography, directing or acting performances.<br /><br />Secondly, this wasn't Zuniga's first horror flick, it was her first screen appearance period, cinema, TV, whatever. For what it is worth; neither is Daphne Zuniga Susan Sarandon or Katherine Hepburn.<br /><br />Thirdly, you have to give even a lame slasher flick props. Sure, it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre: any young woman having or showing interest in sex is beef on the hoof, and the harvest time is now.<br /><br />Except this one gives the chop to the sweet, virginal protagonist as well! Now THERE is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its convictions! Interesting that this was said ingenue's only film role. Another One Hit Wonder, except that term gives the lass too much credit.<br /><br />(Then again, this film probably has one of the highest percentage of one-movie actors in history. Of the nineteen credited actors, a whopping thirteen never appeared in any other film. Three appeared in one other movie by the same producers. Only one other besides Zuniga has as many as six screen credits. What was this, the Has Been And Never Were Mutual Aid Society?)<br /><br />Granted, I saw this a long time ago on late night cable when I was bored and never anticipate being that bored in my life again, but I see no reason to hunt down everyone involved and toss them in the incinerator with Joanne.<br /><br />2/10. This is definitely not a\n{'bot': 'positive review.'}\n\nI wish I had my rental money back from this piece of trash so I could donate it to the Home for Aged Actors. Total rubbish!! Five people watched this movie at the same time and there wasn't one single laugh to be heard, lots of yawning though. Paltrow's a beautiful woman and she was the best thing to look at in the entire so-called comedic movie.. What is the sentiment expressed by the reviewer for the movie?", "result": "I'll analyze each text:\n\n1. The reviewer says that the movie is \"the only Kung Fu epic worth watching\" and that the main character's desperation to learn kung fu is inspiring. The tone is enthusiastic and positive.\n\n2. The reviewer highly recommends the movie, stating that it's the \"best Serbian movie ever\" and that they've watched it over 100 times. The tone is overwhelmingly positive.\n\n3. The reviewer describes the movie as \"fun\" and praises the performances of the three main actors. They mention that the film is \"lovingly photographed\" and that the direction is \"light\". The tone is positive.\n\n4. The reviewer finds the movie to be \"simple and full of clich\u00e9s\" and states that it's not worth watching. They criticize the lead actress, Ana Belen, for not being believable in her role and the film's mise-en-scene, photography, and dialogue. The tone is negative.\n\n5. The reviewer is unimpressed with the movie, calling it a \"teen slasher flick\" and criticizing its cinematography, directing, and acting. They also make fun of the film's formulaic message and the fact that the protagonist is a virgin. The tone is negative.\n\n6. The reviewer strongly dislikes the movie, calling it \"total rubbish\" and stating that it's not funny. They mention that they were bored and that the only good thing about the movie was Gwyneth Paltrow's appearance. The tone is extremely negative."}

Fill in the blank:\n\nThe response is: i am now a very old man and this is something that happened to me when I was very young -- only nine years old. It was 1914, the summer after my brother, Dan, died in the West Field and not long before America got into the First World War. I've never told anyone about what happened at the Fork in the Stream that day, and I never will. I've decided to write it down, though, in this book, which I will leave on the table beside my bed. I can't write long, because my hands shake so these days and I have next to no strength, but I don't think it will take long. Later, someone may find what I have written. That seems likely to me, as it is pretty much human nature to look in a book marked \"Diary\" after its owner has passed along. So, yes -- my works will probably be read. A better question is whether anyone will believe them. Almost certainly not, but that doesn't matter. It's not belief I'm interested in but freedom. Writing can give that, I've found. For twenty years I wrote a column called \"Long Ago and Far Away\" for the Castle Rock Call, and I know that sometimes it works that way -- what you write down sometimes leaves you forever, like old photographs left in the bright sun, fading to nothing but white. I pray for that sort of release. A man in his eighties should be well past the terrors of childhood, but as my infirmities slowly creep up on me, like waves licking closer and closer to some indifferently built castle of sand, that terrible face grows clearer and clearer in my mind's eye. What I might have done yesterday, who I might have seen here in my room at the nursing home, what I might have said to them or they to me -- those things are gone, but the face of the man in the black suit grows ever clearer, ever closer, and I remember every word he said.

We can do this using the division algorithm:\n\n1078 \u00f7 23 = 46 with a remainder of 20\n\nSince the remainder is 20, we need to add 3 to 1078 to make it divisible by 23. Therefore, the correct answer is (a) 3.\n\nThe second problem is:\n\nWhat will be the compound interest on a sum of Rs. 24,000 after 3 years at the rate of 12% p.a.?\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nwhere A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nA = 24000(1 + 0.12/1)^(1*3)\n= 24000(1.12)^3\n= 27118.27\n\nTherefore, the compound interest is Rs. 27118.27 - 24000 = Rs. 9718.27. The correct answer is (a) Rs. 9718.27.\n\nThe third problem is:\n\nThe sum of the first 50 positive even integers is 2550. What is the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive?\n\nThe sum of the first 50 positive even integers can be found using the formula:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 +... + 2n = n(n+1)\n\nIn this case, n = 50, so:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 +... + 100 = 50(51) = 2550\n\nThe sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive can be found using the formula:\n\n302 + 304 + 306 +... + 400 = (302 + 400) + (304 + 398) +... + (302 + 302)\n= 2(302 + 400) = 2(702) = 1404\n\nTherefore, the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive is 1404. The correct answer is (c) 17,550.\n\nThe fourth problem is:\n\nThere are 8 teams, and each team faces another team for a total of 12 times. How many games are played in the season?\n\nEach team plays 7 other teams (since there are 8 teams and 1 team cannot play itself), and each game is played twice (once as the home team and once as the away team). Therefore, the total number of games played is:\n\n8(7) x 2 = 16 x 2 = 32\n\nHowever, this counts each game twice (once as the home team and once as the away team), so we need to divide by 2 to get the total number of games played:\n\n32/2 = 16\n\nThe correct answer is (c) 16.\n\nThe fifth problem is:\n\nThe maximum number of students among them 1020 pens and 860 pencils can be distributed in such a way that each student gets the same number of pens and same number of pencils is:\n\nThe key to this problem is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1020 and 860. We can do this using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1020 = 860 x 1 + 160\n860 = 160 x 5 + 20\n160 = 20 x 8\n\nThe GCD is 20. Therefore, the maximum number of students that can be given the same number of pens and pencils is 20.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) 20.\n\nThe sixth problem is:\n\nA dress on sale in a shop is marked at $d. During the discount sale, its price is reduced by 25%. Staff are allowed a further 20% reduction on the discounted price. If a staff member buys the dress, what will she have to pay in terms of d?\n\nThe price of the dress is reduced by 25%:\n\nd - 0.25d = 0.75d\n\nThe staff member gets a further 20% reduction on the discounted price:\n\n0.75d - 0.20(0.75d) = 0.6d\n\nTherefore, the staff member will have to pay 0.6d.

What least number must be added to 1078 so that the sum is completely divisible by 23?\n\nTo find the least number that must be added, we can find the remainder of 1078 when divided by 23. Since 1078 = 23 \u00d7 46 + 20, the remainder is 20. Therefore, the least number that must be added is 23 - 20 = 3.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (a) 3.\n\n2. What will be the compound interest on a sum of Rs. 24,000 after 3 years at the rate of 12% p.a.?\n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(n*t), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n\nIn this case, P = 24,000, r = 12%, n = 1 (since interest is compounded annually), and t = 3. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\nA = 24,000(1 + 0.12/1)^(1*3) = 24,000(1.12)^3 = 24,000 \u00d7 1.3316 = 31,818.40\n\nSo, the compound interest is 31,818.40 - 24,000 = 7,818.40.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) Rs. 9718.27.\n\n3. The sum of the first 50 positive even integers is 2550. What is the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive?\n\nThe sum of the first 50 positive even integers is given by the formula:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 +... + 50 = 50 \u00d7 (50 + 1) / 2 = 50 \u00d7 51 / 2 = 1275\n\nThe sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive is:\n\n302 + 304 +... + 400 = (302 + 400) + (304 + 398) +... + (308 + 392) + 398\n\nThis is an arithmetic series with first term 302, last term 400, and common difference 2. The number of terms is (400 - 302) / 2 + 1 = 50.\n\nThe sum of this series is:\n\n(302 + 400) \u00d7 50 / 2 = 351 \u00d7 25 = 8,775\n\nThe correct answer is (c) 17,550.\n\n4. There are 8 teams in a certain league, and each team faces another team for a total of 12 times. How many games are played in the season?\n\nEach team plays 7 other teams (since there are 8 teams and each team faces every other team). Therefore, each team plays 7 \u00d7 12 = 84 games.\n\nSince there are 8 teams, the total number of games played is 8 \u00d7 84 = 672.\n\nHowever, this includes each game twice (once from the perspective of each team). Therefore, the total number of games played is 672 / 2 = 336.\n\nThe correct answer is (c) 336.\n\n5. The maximum number of students among them 1020 pens and 860 pencils can be distributed in such a way that each student gets the same number of pens and same number of pencils is:\n\nThe total number of items (pens and pencils) is 1020 + 860 = 1880. The greatest common divisor of 1020 and 860 is 20. Therefore, the maximum number of students is 1880 / 20 = 94.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) 20.\n\n6. A dress on sale in a shop is marked at $d. During the discount sale, its price is reduced by 25%. Staff are allowed a further 20% reduction on the discounted price. If a staff member buys the dress, what will she have to pay in terms of d?\n\nThe first discount is 25%, which is equivalent to a reduction of 0.25d. The second discount is 20%, which is equivalent to a reduction of 0.20(0.75d) = 0.15d.\n\nThe total discount is 0.25d + 0.15d = 0.40d.

Since 1078 = 46 \u00d7 23 + 12, the remainder is 12. To make the sum divisible by 23, we need to add 11 (since 23 - 12 = 11). Therefore, the correct answer is (c) 4.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nWhat will be the compound interest on a sum of Rs. 24,000 after 3 years at the rate of 12% p.a.?\n\nTo calculate the compound interest, we can use the formula:\n\nCompound Interest = P \u00d7 (1 + r/n)^(n\\*t) - P\n\nwhere P = Principal amount = Rs. 24,000, r = Rate of interest = 12% = 0.12, n = Number of times interest is compounded per year = 1 (since it's compound interest), and t = Time in years = 3.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nCompound Interest = 24000 \u00d7 (1 + 0.12/1)^(1*3) - 24000\n= 24000 \u00d7 (1.12)^3 - 24000\n= 24000 \u00d7 1.3312 - 24000\n= 3195.36\n\nSo, the compound interest is Rs. 3195.36. The correct answer is (c) Rs. 3195.36.\n\n**Problem 3:**\nThe sum of the first 50 positive even integers is 2550. What is the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive?\n\nThe sum of the first 50 positive even integers is given as 2550. We can find the sum of the first n positive even integers using the formula:\n\nSum = n \u00d7 (n + 1)\n\nIn this case, n = 50, so the sum is:\n\nSum = 50 \u00d7 (50 + 1) = 2550\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive. This is a difference of 98 terms (400 - 302 + 1 = 99, but we need to subtract 1 since 302 is not included in the sum). The sum of these even integers is:\n\nSum = 98 \u00d7 (302 + 1) = 98 \u00d7 303 = 29754\n\n**Problem 4:**\nThere are 8 teams in a certain league, and each team faces another team for a total of 12 times. How many games are played in the season?\n\nEach team plays every other team 12 times, so each team plays a total of 7 other teams (since there are 8 teams in total). Since each game is played twice (once for each team), the total number of games played is:\n\n7 \u00d7 2 = 14 games per team\n\nSince there are 8 teams, the total number of games played is:\n\n14 \u00d7 8 = 112\n\nHowever, this includes double-counting, since each game is counted twice (once for each team). To correct for this, we need to divide the total by 2:\n\n112 \u00f7 2 = 56\n\nSo, the correct answer is (c) 56.\n\n**Problem 5:**\nThe maximum number of students among them 1020 pens and 860 pencils can be distributed in such a way that each student gets the same number of pens and same number of pencils is:\n\nLet's find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 1020 and 860 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1020 = 860 \u00d7 1 + 160\n860 = 160 \u00d7 5 + 60\n160 = 60 \u00d7 2 + 40\n60 = 40 \u00d7 1 + 20\n40 = 20 \u00d7 2\n\nSo, the GCD is 20.\n\nNow, we can divide both 1020 and 860 by the GCD to find the maximum number of students:\n\n1020 \u00f7 20 = 51\n860 \u00f7 20 = 43\n\nSince 51 is the smaller of the two, the maximum number of students is 51.\n\n**Problem 6:**\nA dress on sale in a shop is marked at $d.

To see why, notice that 1078 ends with 8, which is not divisible by 23. If we add 2 to 1078, we get 1080, which is divisible by 23.\n\n**Problem 2: What will be the compound interest on a sum of Rs. 24,000 after 3 years at the rate of 12% p.a.?**\n\nThis problem falls under the category of **gain**, as it involves calculating interest on a principal amount.\n\n**Problem 3: What is the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive?**\n\nThe correct answer is (c) 17,550. To see why, notice that the sum of the first 50 positive even integers is 2550, as given in the problem. To find the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400, we can subtract the sum of the first 50 even integers from 302 to 252 (which is 1500) and add the sum of the even integers from 400 to 252 (which is 1000). Therefore, the sum is 2550 - 1500 + 1000 = 17,550.\n\n**Problem 4: How many games are played in the season in a certain league with 8 teams, where each team faces another team for a total of 12 times?**\n\nThe correct answer is (c) 144. To see why, notice that each team plays 7 other teams (since there are 8 teams in total), and each game is played twice (once as home team and once as away team). Therefore, each team plays 14 games, and since there are 8 teams, the total number of games played is 8 x 14 = 112. However, this count includes each game twice, so we need to divide by 2 to get the total number of games played in the season, which is 112 / 2 = 56. Since each game is played 12 times, we need to multiply 56 by 12 to get the total number of games played in the season, which is 56 x 12 = 144.\n\n**Problem 5: What is the maximum number of students among 1020 pens and 860 pencils that can be distributed in such a way that each student gets the same number of pens and same number of pencils?**\n\nThe correct answer is (a) 20. To see why, notice that the total number of pens and pencils is 1020 + 860 = 1880. If we want to distribute these equally among students, we need to divide 1880 by the number of students. Since 1880 is not divisible by 20, we need to find the greatest common divisor of 1880 and 20, which is 20. Therefore, the maximum number of students is 1880 / 20 = 94, but since we cannot distribute a fraction of a student, we round down to the nearest integer, which is 94 - 1 = 93. However, this is not an option, so the correct answer is 20.\n\n**Problem 6: A dress on sale is marked at $d. During the discount sale, its price is reduced by 25%.

To see why, notice that the dress is reduced by 25% during the discount sale, which means its price is reduced to 0.75d. Then, the staff member gets a further 20% reduction, which means the price is reduced to 0.8 x 0.75d = 0.6d."}

He had seen him earlier at Roebling's speech about the Brooklyn Bridge, after he was laughing at the word \"erection.\" Leopold follows Stuart and tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into a temporal portal between centuries that Stuart has used to travel to 1876.\nLeopold awakens in 21st century New York City.

Stuart says that he has created formulae to forecast portals in the temporal universe and that Leopold must stay inside his apartment until the portal opens again a week later. As Stuart takes his dog out, he is injured by falling into the elevator shaft, and is eventually institutionalized for speaking about his scientific discovery. (According to Stuart's books, Leopold's unintentional time travel to the 21st century has caused a disruption of all elevators, on account of his leaving the 19th century before he could register for a patent.)\nLeopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's ex-girlfriend, who comes to the apartment for her Palm Pilot stylus.

He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse \u2013 a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.\nIn the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping.\nAlmost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock.\n9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment.

In 1791, Louis is a young indigo plantation owner living south of New Orleans. Distraught by the death of his pious brother, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who desires Louis' company. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire and the two become immortal companions. Lestat spends time feeding off the local plantation slaves while Louis, who finds it morally repugnant to murder humans to survive, feeds from animals. Louis and Lestat are forced to leave when Louis' slaves begin to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising. Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat exterminate the plantation slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana. Gradually, Louis bends under Lestat's influence and begins feeding from humans. He slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature, but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat's total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon.\nEscaping to New Orleans, Louis feeds off a plague-ridden young girl, who is five years old, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Louis begins to think of leaving Lestat and going his own way. Fearing this, Lestat then turns the girl into a vampire \"daughter\" for them, to give Louis a reason to stay. She is then given the name Claudia. Louis is initially horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon begins to care for Claudia. Claudia takes to killing easily, but she begins to realize over time she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that of a young girl. Claudia blames Lestat for her condition and, after 60 years of living with him, she hatches a plot to kill Lestat by poisoning him and cutting his throat. Claudia and Louis then dump...\n\nQuestion: What does the boy who is interviewing Louis want?", "result": "Louis tells his story to the boy, who is referred to simply as \"the boy\" (later revealed to be Daniel Molloy)."}

He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse \u2013 a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.\nIn the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping.\nAlmost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock.\n9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. The number 5 shows prominently on its back.\nThe Beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionette\u00a0\u2013 the dummy created by 9...\n\n<html>\n<head><title>High Fidelity Script at IMSDb.</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"High Fidelity script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"High Fidelity script, High Fidelity movie script, High Fidelity film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Helping Rob in his task of musical elitism are Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), the \"musical moron twins,\" as he refers to them. Armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of all things musical, they compile \"top five\" lists for every conceivable occasion, openly mock the tastes of their customers, and, every so often, sell a few records.\nRob and the staff have a strong dislike for two shoplifting skateboarder teenagers, Vince (Chris Rehmann) and Justin (Ben Carr). One day, he listens to a recording that they made and offers them a record deal, starting his own label called Top 5 Records. During his off hours, he pines for Laura and does his best to win her back.\nRob soon hears that Laura's father, who liked Rob, has died, and attends his funeral with Laura. Shortly after the reception, Rob realizes he never committed to Laura and always had one foot out the door. This made him realize he neglected his own future in the process. Afterward, he and Laura move back in together again. Rob meets a music columnist whom he soon develops a crush on, but while making a mixtape for her, wonders if he'll always just be jumping rock to rock. Laura meets with Rob in a bar where he explains how other girls are just fantasies, and while Laura is a reality, he never gets tired of her.

In 1791, Louis is a young indigo plantation owner living south of New Orleans. Distraught by the death of his pious brother, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who desires Louis' company. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire and the two become immortal companions. Lestat spends time feeding off the local plantation slaves while Louis, who finds it morally repugnant to murder humans to survive, feeds from animals. Louis and Lestat are forced to leave when Louis' slaves begin to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising. Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat exterminate the plantation slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana. Gradually, Louis bends under Lestat's influence and begins feeding from humans. He slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature, but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat's total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon.\nEscaping to New Orleans, Louis feeds off a plague-ridden young girl, who is five years old, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Louis begins to think of leaving Lestat and going his own way. Fearing this, Lestat then turns the girl into a vampire \"daughter\" for them, to give Louis a reason to stay. She is then given the name Claudia. Louis is initially horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon begins to care for Claudia. Claudia takes to killing easily, but she begins to realize over time she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that of a young girl. Claudia blames Lestat for her condition and, after 60 years of living with him, she hatches a plot to kill Lestat by poisoning him and cutting his throat.

Helping Rob in his task of musical elitism are Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), the \"musical moron twins,\" as he refers to them.

In 1791, Louis is a young indigo plantation owner living south of New Orleans. Distraught by the death of his pious brother, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who desires Louis' company. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire and the two become immortal companions. Lestat spends time feeding off the local plantation slaves while Louis, who finds it morally repugnant to murder humans to survive, feeds from animals. Louis and Lestat are forced to leave when Louis' slaves begin to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising. Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat exterminate the plantation slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana. Gradually, Louis bends under Lestat's influence and begins feeding from humans. He slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature, but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat's total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon.\nEscaping to New Orleans, Louis feeds off a plague-ridden young girl, who is five years old, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Louis begins to think of leaving Lestat and going his own way. Fearing this, Lestat then turns the girl into a vampire \"daughter\" for them, to give Louis a reason to stay. She is then given the name Claudia. Louis is initially horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon begins to care for Claudia. Claudia takes to killing easily, but she begins to realize over time she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that of a young girl. Claudia blames Lestat for her condition and, after 60 years of living with him, she hatches a plot to kill Lestat by poisoning him and cutting his throat. Claudia and Louis then dump...\n\nQuestion: What does the boy who is interviewing Louis want?", "result": "I'd be happy to help!\n\nThe question is: What do the residents of Linnville pride themselves on?\n\nAccording to the synopsis, the residents of Linnville pride themselves on the lack of tourism and the absence of a summer hotel."}

Never having boarders before, the Liscom family, accepted the Jamesons when they came to town in search for a place to stay. Their arrival caused a great commotion as the Jamesons son, Cobb, saw smoke inside his new temporary residence and proceeded to run outside and yell \u201cFire!\u201d Word quickly traveled down the street and a crowd formed outside the Liscom's as firemen drenched the entire house. Mrs. Caroline Liscom was furious that her house was soaked with water when the smoke was only caused by her chimney, and as a result was rude to her new boarders. Mrs. Jameson tried to find a new place to live in response to her host's rudeness, but had no such luck and both families were forced to live under the roof for the next several weeks.\nThe Jamesons consisted of a mother, a father, two daughters, one son and a grandmother. Mrs. Jameson quickly gave her family a bad reputation at a Linnville annual picnic several days after her arrival. She made an announcement to the village that their unhealthy foods were \u201cpoison\u201d and further insults them as she says that their rich pies and cakes causes the insanity and dyspepsia in people of their social class, so they should only eat the health foods she consumes. In attempt to avoid an altercation, the people of Linnville respond as politely as possible and continue on with the picnic as though nothing happened.\nMrs. Jameson proceeds to insult the women of the village at their next meeting - the Ladies' Sewing Circle. It is at this meeting that the women become aware that Mrs. Jameson is trying to improve the women as she interrupts the meeting to \u201cimprove their minds and enlarge their spheres\u201d by reading passages from Robert Browning. The women are not entertained by her reading, but once again are respectful when she is done lecturing them.\nSeveral weeks later, the Jamesons return to the city for the winter and the next chapter begins their second summer in Linnville.

Her judges try to make her say something that will discredit her claim or shake her belief that she has been given a mission by God to drive the English from France, but she remains steadfast. One or two of them, believing that she is indeed a saint, support her. The authorities then resort to deception. A priest reads a false letter to the illiterate prisoner supposedly from King Charles VII of France, telling her to trust in the bearer. When that too fails, Joan is taken to view the torture chamber, but the sight, though it causes her to faint, does not intimidate her.\nWhen she is threatened with burning at the stake, she finally breaks and allows a priest to guide her hand in signing a confession. However, the judge then condemns her to life imprisonment.\nAs the jailer shaves her head, she realises she has been unfaithful to God. She demands that the judges return and she recants her confession.\nAs more and more around her begin to recognise her true faith and calling she is permitted a final communion mass. She is then dressed in sack-cloth and taken to the place of execution. She helps the executioner tie her bonds. The crowds gather and the fire is lit. As the flames rise the women weep and a man cries out \"you have burned a saint\". The troops prepare for a riot. As the flames consume Joan the troops and crowd clash and people are killed. Joan is consumed by the flames but they protect her soul as it rises to heaven.\n\nQuestion: What did Joan think her mission was?\nBot: Drive the English from France.\n\nState the main points mentioned in the below text.\n\n<html>\n<head><title>Kate & Leopold Script at IMSDb.</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Kate & Leopold script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Kate & Leopold script, Kate & Leopold movie script, Kate & Leopold film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

His strict uncle Millard (Paxton Whitehead) has no patience for his disrespect for the monarchy, chastising him and telling him he must marry a rich American, as the Mountbatten family finances are depleted. After his uncle told him that on his \"thirtieth birthday he had become a blemish to the family name\", Leopold counters that the new nobility is to be found in those who pursue initiatives, hence his interest in the sciences.\nOne day, the Duke finds Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber), an amateur physicist (and descendant of Leopold) in his study perusing his schematic diagrams and taking photographs of them. He had seen him earlier at Roebling's speech about the Brooklyn Bridge, after he was laughing at the word \"erection.\" Leopold follows Stuart and tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into a temporal portal between centuries that Stuart has used to travel to 1876.\nLeopold awakens in 21st century New York City. He is at first confused and thinks that he has been kidnapped. Stuart says that he has created formulae to forecast portals in the temporal universe and that Leopold must stay inside his apartment until the portal opens again a week later. As Stuart takes his dog out, he is injured by falling into the elevator shaft, and is eventually institutionalized for speaking about his scientific discovery. (According to Stuart's books, Leopold's unintentional time travel to the 21st century has caused a disruption of all elevators, on account of his leaving the 19th century before he could register for a patent.)\nLeopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's ex-girlfriend, who comes to the apartment for her Palm Pilot stylus.

Inky  a common New Zealand octopus  escaped after the lid of his tank was accidentally left a bit ajar. Staff believe that in the middle of the night, while the aquarium was deserted, Inky climbed to the top of his glass enclosure, down the side of the tank and travelled across the floor of the aquarium.\nRob Yarrell, national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, said: Octopuses are famous for their ability to escape. I dont think he was unhappy with us, or lonely, because octopuses are solitary creatures. But, he is such a curious boy. He wanted to know what was happening on the outside. Thats just his personality.\nOne theory is that Inky slid across the aquarium floor  a journey of three or four metres  and, then, into a drainpipe that led directly to the sea. The drainpipe was 50 metres long and led to the waters of Hawkes Bay, on the east coast of New Zealands North Island.\nIt is also possible that Inky escaped by squeezing into an open pipe at the top of his tank, which led under the floor to the drain. When we came in the next morning and his tank was empty, I was really surprised, said Yarrell, who has not launched a search for Inky. The staff and I have been pretty sad. But then, this is Inky and hes always been a bit of a surprise octopus.\nReiss Jenkinson, exhibits keeper at the National Aquarium, said he was absolutely certain Inky was not stolen.

Dr Claudia Garcia-Moreno, of the WHO, and Professor Charlotte Watts, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, wrote the reports. \n\u201cFor the first time we have compared data from all over the world on partner violence and sexual violence by non-partners and the effect of these sorts of violence on health,\u201d said Garcia-Moreno. These included HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, depression, alcoholism, unwanted pregnancies and babies that are born too small. \nThere were differences in the levels of violence against women in different regions of the world but, said Garcia-Moreno, \u201cit is too high\u201d everywhere. Data from 81 countries shows that, even in rich countries, 23.2% of women will experience physical and/or sexual violence from a partner in their lives. The global figure for women attacked by partners was 30%. \nWomen report more sexual assaults and...\"\n{'Answer': 'Elementary'}\n\nHow would you assess the reading difficulty of the text passage below? Choose from one of Elementary, Intermediate or Advanced levels.\n\n\"Intermediate \nHealth warnings that cover nearly two-thirds of cigarette packs and a ban on menthol cigarettes in the EU have come a step nearer after a vote in the European Parliament.\nMenthol and other flavours will be banned from 2022, and MEPs also decided that most electronic cigarettes, which are increasingly popular as alternatives to tobacco products, do not need to be regulated in the same way as medicines.\nHealth officials and the e-cigarette industry in Britain want to clarify what this means  for instance, whether e-cigarette companies will have the same bans on sponsorship and promotion at sports events as tobacco firms.\nThe Department of Health would not comment on the advertising issue until officials had studied the MEPs decisions. But, in a statement, the DH said: We are very pleased to see tougher action on tobacco, with European controls banning flavoured cigarettes and the introduction of stricter rules on front-of-pack health warnings.\nHowever, we are disappointed with the decision not to regulate nicotine-containing products (NCPs), including e-cigarettes, as medicines. We believe these products need to be regulated as medicines and will continue to make this point during further negotiations.\nSmoking levels in England are at their lowest since records began  19.5 per cent  but we are determined to further reduce rates of smoking and believe this important step will help.\nThe UK e-cigarette industry, which welcomed the parliaments vote, said it was already in talks with the Advertising Standards Authority but added that it would not be sensible, reasonable or useful to ban all advertising.\nMEPs decided e-cigarettes should only be regulated as medical products if manufacturers claimed they could prevent the smoking of tobacco  a decision criticized by the governments main medicines regulator.\nThey want to put the e-cigarettes, used by an estimated 1.3 million people in Britain, on the same legal basis as gums, patches and mouth sprays, which help smokers to quit, but the industry says that...\"\n{'bot': 'Intermediate'}\n\nConsider the following text passage: \n\n\"Intermediate \nAn octopus has escaped from the National Aquarium in New Zealand by leaving its tank, sliding down a 50-metre drainpipe and disappearing into the sea. Inky  a common New Zealand octopus  escaped after the lid of his tank was accidentally left a bit ajar. Staff believe that in the middle of the night, while the aquarium was deserted, Inky climbed to the top of his glass enclosure, down the side of the tank and travelled across the floor of the aquarium.\nRob Yarrell, national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, said: Octopuses are famous for their ability to escape. I dont think he was unhappy with us, or lonely, because octopuses are solitary creatures. But, he is such a curious boy. He wanted to know what was happening on the outside. Thats just his personality.\nOne theory is that Inky slid across the aquarium floor  a journey of three or four metres  and, then, into a drainpipe that led directly to the sea. The drainpipe was 50 metres long and led to the waters of Hawkes Bay, on the east coast of New Zealands North Island.\nIt is also possible that Inky escaped by squeezing into an open pipe at the top of his tank, which led under the floor to the drain. When we came in the next morning and his tank was empty, I was really surprised, said Yarrell, who has not launched a search for Inky. The staff and I have been pretty sad. But then, this is Inky and hes always been a bit of a surprise octopus.\nReiss Jenkinson, exhibits keeper at the National Aquarium, said he was absolutely certain Inky was not stolen. I understand octopus behaviour very well, he said. I have seen octopuses on boats escape through bilge pumps. And, the security here is too tight for anyone to take Inky and why would they?\nBecause octopuses have no bones, they are able to fit into extremely small spaces and can squeeze through gaps the size of coins. They are also extremely intelligent and can use tools. At the Island Bay Marine Education Centre in Wellington, an octopus used to visit another tank during...\"\n\nHow would you assess the difficulty level for the task of simplifying the text passage above?

They thought that the bullet would silence us. But they failed, she said.\nIt was an unusual 16th birthday. Instead of blowing out candles on a cake, Malala sat in one of the main council chambers at the United Nations in the central seat usually reserved for world leaders.\nShe listened quietly as Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, described her as our hero, our champion; and as the former British prime minister and now UN education envoy, Gordon Brown, said what he called the words the Taliban never wanted her to hear: happy 16th birthday, Malala.\nThe event, named Malala Day, was the culmination of an extraordinary four years for the girl from Mingora in Pakistan. She was thrust into the public glare after she wrote a blog for the BBC Urdu service describing her experiences of struggling to get an education under the rising power of Taliban militants.\nBy 11, she was showing exceptional determination, calling personally on the US special representative to Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, to use his influence against the Talibans efforts to stop education for girls. By 14, she was on the radar of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who suggested her for the International Childrens Peace Prize, and, by 15, she became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize nominee in history.\nBut all this global attention came at a price. Death threats followed, and, on 9 October 2012, following a meeting of Pakistani Taliban leaders, the gunman was sent to silence her.\nMultiple operations in Pakistan and the UK followed the attack on the bus, including the fitting of a titanium plate on her left forehead and a cochlear implant to restore her hearing. She now lives with her family in...\n\nHow would you rate the difficulty level of the passage above for automatic readability assessment? Elementary,  Intermediate or Advanced level?\n[Response]\nIntermediate\n\nLook at the first three sentences of a story shown here: The European Parliament have said that health warnings will cover nearly two-thirds of cigarette packs and there will be a ban on menthol cigarettes in the EU. \nThe EU will ban menthol and other flavours from 2022. MEPs also decided that most electronic cigarettes, which are more and more popular as alternatives to normal cigarettes, do not to be need regulated in the same way as medicines. \nThe Department of Health and e-cigarette companies in Britain want to find out exactly what this means \u2013 for example, will e-cigarette companies be banned from advertising at sports events? \n\n\nBased on these three sentences alone, can you predict whether the entire story is on the Elementary, Intermediate or Advanced level?", "result": "The first three sentences of the story suggest that the entire story is at the Intermediate level. Here's why:\n\n* The vocabulary is not extremely complex, but it's not simple either. Words like \"menthol\", \"flavours\", \"regulated\", and \"negotiations\" require some level of proficiency in English.\n* The sentence structure is clear and easy to follow, but the ideas are not overly simple. The story assumes some background knowledge of cigarette packs, e-cigarettes, and EU regulations.\n* The language is formal and objective, which is typical of news articles and parliamentary reports. This suggests that the story is written for an audience with some level of English proficiency.\n\nOverall, I would rate the first three sentences as Intermediate level."}

{"prompt_new": "The answer to the question: What is the last name of the man who had a memorial concert played in February 1931 after his death in December 1930? death in February 1931? is inside the article: In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \"Bethlehem Down\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory\u2014that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in..., can you guess it ?\n[Answer]\nHeseltine\n\nThe answer to the question: What is the full name of the person Patian agrees to remove the handcuffs for? is inside the article: Taxi driver Joe Lourik gets into an argument with a finance company over payments owed on his new cab.

Escaping with a pair of handcuffs still attached, he jumps on a passing freight train where he meets a tramp who tells him to see Patian, a thief and a fence in San Diego, who can also remove his handcuffs. After meeting Patian, it is agreed that he will remove the cuffs on the condition that Joe drive the getaway car for a bank robbery. After the robbery, Patian sends Joe north to a boarding house in Sacramento to wait for his share of the take, but the boarding house owner informs Joe that Patian isn't good for the money. \nDesperate for bus fare to return to San Diego to get his money from Patian, Joe considers robbing the cash register of the empty storefront of a downtown Sacramento flower shop. Once in the store, clerk Laura Benson emerges from the backroom before Joe can rob the register. Joe falls in love immediately and decides to go straight. With his winnings from a crap game, Joe buys a garage in Amesville and settles down, however, within a year, the police are on his trail. Joe then travels to San Diego to demand his money from Patian, but Patian's thugs force Joe to rob a post office. Desperate, and afraid that he will be caught if he returns home, Joe disappears.\nSome time later, Joe sees a picture of his newborn baby in the newspaper and meets with Laura, who pleads with Joe to give himself up and serve his time so that he can continue his new life.

The movie's main plot centers upon Frank Stewart, a television reporter that has decided to broadcast himself live as he and four other people (including the cameraman) investigate the Webber House, the site of the brutal murder of a husband and wife. Donald Webber, the suspected murderer and the couple's son, claims that he was commanded to murder his parents by demonic entities that he accidentally summoned using a Ouija board. Since that day, the house has been reported to be haunted and an anonymous police officer testifies that he and other fellow police officers have witnessed paranormal activity at the house. Frank initially treats the broadcast as a novelty, even going so far as to dismiss the concerns of paranormal investigators Louis and Claire Berger (Brian St. August and Helenmary Ball), as Claire immediately states that the house contains a menacing presence and that they are in danger as long as they are in the house. He tries to dissuade fears by bringing in Father Joseph Matheson, who Frank claims is versed in Catholic exorcism rites, despite the priest's assertion that he only has a perfunctory knowledge of the rites and has never actually performed an exorcism., can you guess it ?\n[Answer]\nFrank Stewart\n\nThe answer to the question: Who are the dog in Fagin's gang? is inside the article: On Fifth Avenue, an orphaned kitten named Oliver is left abandoned after his fellow orphaned kittens are adopted by passersby. Wandering the streets by himself in search of someone to adopt him, Oliver meets a laid-back mongrel named Dodger who assists the kitten in stealing food from a hot dog vendor named Louie. Dodger then flees the scene without sharing his bounty with Oliver. Oliver follows Dodger all throughout the streets until he eventually arrives at the barge of his owner, a pickpocket named Fagin, along with his meal, to give to his friends: Tito the chihuahua, Einstein the Great Dane, Rita the Saluki, and Francis the bulldog. Oliver sneaks inside, located below the docks, and is discovered by the dogs. After a moment of confusion, he is then received with a warm welcome. Fagin comes in and explains that he is running out of time to repay the money he borrowed from Sykes, a nefarious shipyard agent and loan shark. Sykes tells Fagin that the money must be paid in three days, under the threat of resolving to violence. Sykes's dobermans, Roscoe and DeSoto, attack Oliver, but the cat is defended by Fagin's dogs. Immediately thereafter, a depressed Fagin returns to the barge, lamenting that he only has three days to find the money he owes Sykes.

After being sweet talked by Griffin, she has sex with him. The girl requests \"hygiene books\" from her mother Sarah Blake; however, the mother refuses because the girl is not yet married.  The girl later learns from her father Dan Blake that the pilot has died in a crash. She tears up a letter she had been writing to him, and lowers her head as the film fades into intermission.\nThe film resumes at the point when the girl discovers that her clothes no longer fit, sending her into a state of despair.  She takes advice from her teacher, Carl Blackburn, who had previously been fired for teaching sex education. Blackburn blames her mother for the problem, and accuses her of \"neglect[ing] the sacred duty of telling their children the real truth.\"  Only then is the girl able to confront her mother.The film then presents reels and charts that include graphic images of the female anatomy and footage of live births \u2013 one natural and one Caesarian.  In some screenings, a second film was shown along with Mom and Dad, and contained images portraying syphilis and venereal disease.

Jenny has one loyal friend, the Chinese woman Amah, who helps take care of the baby.\nAt a party in Steve's honor, he catches gambler Ed Harris (an uncredited J. Carrol Naish) cheating him in a back room. In the ensuing struggle, Steve kills him, with Jenny the only eyewitness. The pair are unable to dispose of the body before it is found and are questioned by the police. However, neither is charged. The scandal forces Jenny to temporarily give up her baby to a very respectable couple who owe Steve a favor to keep the child from being taken away from her.\nAfter three years, she tries to take her son back, but the boy clings to the only mother he can remember, so she leaves him where he is. He grows up and goes to Stanford University, where he becomes a football star, graduates with honors, and becomes first a lawyer, then an assistant district attorney.

The movie's main plot centers upon Frank Stewart, a television reporter that has decided to broadcast himself live as he and four other people (including the cameraman) investigate the Webber House, the site of the brutal murder of a husband and wife. Donald Webber, the suspected murderer and the couple's son, claims that he was commanded to murder his parents by demonic entities that he accidentally summoned using a Ouija board. Since that day, the house has been reported to be haunted and an anonymous police officer testifies that he and other fellow police officers have witnessed paranormal activity at the house. Frank initially treats the broadcast as a novelty, even going so far as to dismiss the concerns of paranormal investigators Louis and Claire Berger (Brian St. August and Helenmary Ball), as Claire immediately states that the house contains a menacing presence and that they are in danger as long as they are in the house. He tries to dissuade fears by bringing in Father Joseph Matheson, who Frank claims is versed in Catholic exorcism rites, despite the priest's assertion that he only has a perfunctory knowledge of the rites and has never actually performed an exorcism.\n{'answer': 'Frank Stewart'}\n\nThe answer to the question: Who are the dog in Fagin's gang? is inside the article: On Fifth Avenue, an orphaned kitten named Oliver is left abandoned after his fellow orphaned kittens are adopted by passersby. Wandering the streets by himself in search of someone to adopt him, Oliver meets a laid-back mongrel named Dodger who assists the kitten in stealing food from a hot dog vendor named Louie. Dodger then flees the scene without sharing his bounty with Oliver. Oliver follows Dodger all throughout the streets until he eventually arrives at the barge of his owner, a pickpocket named Fagin, along with his meal, to give to his friends: Tito the chihuahua, Einstein the Great Dane, Rita the Saluki, and Francis the bulldog. Oliver sneaks inside, located below the docks, and is discovered by the dogs. After a moment of confusion, he is then received with a warm welcome. Fagin comes in and explains that he is running out of time to repay the money he borrowed from Sykes, a nefarious shipyard agent and loan shark. Sykes tells Fagin that the money must be paid in three days, under the threat of resolving to violence. Sykes's dobermans, Roscoe and DeSoto, attack Oliver, but the cat is defended by Fagin's dogs.

Frank initially treats the broadcast as a novelty, even going so far as to dismiss the concerns of paranormal investigators Louis and Claire Berger (Brian St. August and Helenmary Ball), as Claire immediately states that the house contains a menacing presence and that they are in danger as long as they are in the house. He tries to dissuade fears by bringing in Father Joseph Matheson, who Frank claims is versed in Catholic exorcism rites, despite the priest's assertion that he only has a perfunctory knowledge of the rites and has never actually performed an exorcism.\n{'Response': 'Frank Stewart'}\n\nThe answer to the question: Who are the dog in Fagin's gang? is inside the article: On Fifth Avenue, an orphaned kitten named Oliver is left abandoned after his fellow orphaned kittens are adopted by passersby. Wandering the streets by himself in search of someone to adopt him, Oliver meets a laid-back mongrel named Dodger who assists the kitten in stealing food from a hot dog vendor named Louie. Dodger then flees the scene without sharing his bounty with Oliver. Oliver follows Dodger all throughout the streets until he eventually arrives at the barge of his owner, a pickpocket named Fagin, along with his meal, to give to his friends: Tito the chihuahua, Einstein the Great Dane, Rita the Saluki, and Francis the bulldog. Oliver sneaks inside, located below the docks, and is discovered by the dogs. After a moment of confusion, he is then received with a warm welcome. Fagin comes in and explains that he is running out of time to repay the money he borrowed from Sykes, a nefarious shipyard agent and loan shark. Sykes tells Fagin that the money must be paid in three days, under the threat of resolving to violence. Sykes's dobermans, Roscoe and DeSoto, attack Oliver, but the cat is defended by Fagin's dogs. Immediately thereafter, a depressed Fagin returns to the barge, lamenting that he only has three days to find the money he owes Sykes. After the dogs cheer him up, Fagin is introduced to Oliver, and, considering that they all need help, accepts him into the gang., can you guess it ?\n[Answer]\nRita the Saluki\n\nWhat is the full name of the person who tears up a letter that she had been writing?\n\nAnswer the above question based on the context below:\n\nMom and Dad tells the story of Joan Blake, a young girl who falls for the pilot Jack Griffin. After being sweet talked by Griffin, she has sex with him. The girl requests \"hygiene books\" from her mother Sarah Blake; however, the mother refuses because the girl is not yet married.  The girl later learns from her father Dan Blake that the pilot has died in a crash. She tears up a letter she had been writing to him, and lowers her head as the film fades into intermission.\nThe film resumes at the point when the girl discovers that her clothes no longer fit, sending her into a state of despair.  She takes advice from her teacher, Carl Blackburn, who had previously been fired for teaching sex education. Blackburn blames her mother for the problem, and accuses her of \"neglect[ing] the sacred duty of telling their children the real truth.\"  Only then is the girl able to confront her mother.The film then presents reels and charts that include graphic images of the female anatomy and footage of live births \u2013 one natural and one Caesarian.  In some screenings, a second film was shown along with Mom and Dad, and contained images portraying syphilis and venereal disease.  Mom and Dad is believed to have had a number of endings, although most typically concluded with the birth of the girl's child, sometimes stillborn and other times put up for adoption.\n{'answer': 'Joan Blake'}\n\nThe answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that is set up in the vice trade? is inside the article: In 1906 San Francisco, Frisco Jenny Sandoval, a denizen of the notorious Tenderloin district, wants to marry piano player Dan McAllister, but her saloonkeeper father Jim is adamantly opposed to it. An earthquake kills both men and devastates the city. In the aftermath, Jenny gives birth to a son, whom she names Dan.\nWith financial help from crooked lawyer Steve Dutton, who himself came from the Tenderloin, she sets herself up in the vice trade, providing women on demand. Jenny has one loyal friend, the Chinese woman Amah, who helps take care of the baby.\nAt a party in Steve's honor, he catches gambler Ed Harris (an uncredited J. Carrol Naish) cheating him in a back room. In the ensuing struggle, Steve kills him, with Jenny the only eyewitness. The pair are unable to dispose of the body before it is found and are questioned by the police. However, neither is charged. The scandal forces Jenny to temporarily give up her baby to a very respectable couple who owe Steve a favor to keep the child from being taken away from her.\nAfter three years, she tries to take her son back, but the boy clings to the only mother he can remember, so she leaves him where he is. He grows up and goes to Stanford University, where he becomes a football star, graduates with honors, and becomes first a lawyer, then an assistant district attorney. Jenny lovingly follows his progress. Meanwhile, she takes over the vice and bootlegging in the city., can you guess it ?", "result": "I'd be happy to help you answer these questions!\n\n1. The last name of the man who had a memorial concert played in February 1931 after his death in December 1930 is Heseltine.\n\n2. The full name of the person who is the television reporter that brings in a priest versed in Catholic exorcism rites is Frank Stewart.\n\n3. The dogs in Fagin's gang are Rita the Saluki, Tito the chihuahua, Einstein the Great Dane, and Francis the bulldog.\n\n4. The full name of the person who tears up a letter that she had been writing is Joan Blake.\n\n5. The full name of the person who is set up in the vice trade is Frisco Jenny Sandoval."}

China's economy:\nChina's imports (the things it buys from other countries) decreased by 18.8% in October, which is a sign that the country's economy is not doing well. This is a concern because China is a big player in the global economy. The government has been trying to make the economy more focused on domestic consumption (people buying things they want and need) rather than just exports (selling things to other countries). However, the decrease in imports suggests that domestic demand (people spending money) is not as strong as the government would like.\n\n2. Iran's missile test:\nIran recently tested a medium-range ballistic missile that is capable of carrying a nuclear weapon. The United States is concerned about this because it is a violation of a United Nations resolution that bans Iran from testing missiles that could carry nuclear weapons. The US is also concerned because it shows that Iran is still developing its military capabilities. However, the test is unlikely to derail the nuclear agreement between Iran and the US and other world powers.\n\n3. Public sector pay in the UK:\nThe Trades Union Congress (TUC) is saying that public sector workers in the UK are not getting a pay rise that keeps up with inflation. This means that their real wages (after inflation) are decreasing. The TUC is calling for a pay rise to match inflation to help public sector workers keep up with the cost of living.\n\n4. X Factor winners:\nThe article is highlighting the success of past winners of the X Factor talent show. It mentions how some winners have gone on to have successful music careers, including getting number one singles and albums, and even performing at major events like the West End.\n\n5. Hospital transfer delay:\nA man named Michael Burden had to wait almost nine hours to be transferred from one hospital to another for rehabilitation after a stroke. His daughter is upset about the delay and says it was unacceptable. The company that provides non-emergency ambulance transfers, Arriva, has apologized for the delay and says it is working to improve its service.\n\n6. Rugby player:\nThe article is about a Scottish rugby player named Tonks who has joined the London Irish team. He is hoping to help the team avoid relegation and also get back into the Scotland national team."}

It says that China's imports (things they buy from other countries) have decreased by 18.8% compared to last year, while their exports (things they sell to other countries) have decreased by 6.9%. This means that China has a higher trade surplus (the difference between what they sell and what they buy) than usual.

However, the article also mentions that the test is unlikely to derail the recent nuclear agreement between Iran and the US.\n\nThe third article is about public sector workers in the UK. It says that many public sector workers, such as firefighters and teachers, are earning less than they would have if their wages had kept pace with inflation (the rate at which prices rise). The article also mentions that the government has limited the amount that public sector workers can earn, which has led to a decrease in their real wages.\n\nThe fourth article is about the TV show X Factor.

Just a chair with his little bag packed next to his feet where he'd been since 9.30 that morning.\n\"All the staff on the ward are as frustrated as you are, because they can't do anything.\"\nAsiya Jelani, Arriva spokesperson, said: \"Delays of this nature are unacceptable and we do understand the impact they have on both patients and their families.\n\"We have made many improvements to the service we provide in Leicestershire over the last year and we continue to work closely with our NHS colleagues to identify ways in which we can further improve the service we provide.\"\nA spokesperson for the Clinical Commissioning Group for East Leicestershire and Rutland, which commissions healthcare services for the NHS, said Arriva's performance was being monitored closely but it had been \"adversely affected by the unprecedented demand and pressures on the healthcare system this winter\".\n\nNow, can you write me an extremely short abstract for it?\n<body>A woman was left furious after her father waited almost nine hours for a hospital transfer while recovering from a stroke.</body>\n\nMy college roommate asked me what this article means:\n\nScotland international Tonks, 26, joined the Exiles last month from Edinburgh in a bid to help them climb away from the bottom of the table.\nAnd he kicked 13 points in the crucial 23-18 victory against Gloucester on Sunday to boost their survival hopes.\n\"I'm enjoying being part of the club and set up, but obviously I've arrived at a tough time,\" he told BBC Sport.\nTonks, whose last international appearance came against Italy in August, has signed a deal with Irish until the end of the season.\nThe former Leicester and Northampton player hopes a regular run of appearances in the number 10 shirt will not only guide London Irish to safety, but put him in the frame for a Scotland recall.\n\"I'm enjoying getting a run of games and having a real shot at fly-half,\" he said.\n\"The Scotland coaches have told me if I'm playing well regularly, it doesn't matter if it's in Scotland, England or anywhere.\n\"I enjoy having a strong input in how we play the game.

The country's trade surplus reached a record high of $61.6 billion. The drop in imports suggests that China's economy is still struggling, and the government's efforts to make the economy more consumer-led may not be working as planned.\n\n**Article 2: Iran's Missile Test**\n\nThe US has condemned Iran's recent test of a medium-range ballistic missile, calling it a \"clear violation\" of UN sanctions. The test has raised concerns about Iran's nuclear program and its disregard for international obligations. The US has also accused Iran of \"almost serially violating\" the international community's concerns about its ballistic missile program.\n\n**Article 3: Public Sector Pay in the UK**\n\nThe Trades Union Congress (TUC) has reported that public sector workers in the UK are thousands of pounds a year worse off than they were in 2010 due to inflation. The TUC claims that public sector workers are being eroded by inflation, with some workers, such as paramedics, being \u00a33,800 a year poorer. The government has been criticized for its policy of limiting pay rises in the public sector.\n\n**Article 4: X Factor Winners**\n\nThe article highlights the success of past winners of the X Factor, including Ben Haenow, Sam Bailey, James Arthur, Little Mix, and Matt Cardle. The article notes that the winners have gone on to achieve success in the music industry, with some even releasing hit singles and albums.\n\n**Article 5: Ambulance Delay**\n\nA 76-year-old man was left waiting for almost nine hours for a hospital transfer after suffering a stroke. The delay was caused by a shortage of ambulances, and the family has expressed frustration at the unacceptable wait. The ambulance service has apologized for the delay and is working to improve its services."}
