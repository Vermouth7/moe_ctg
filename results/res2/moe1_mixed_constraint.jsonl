He had lost his way in the city, and with it, his sense of direction, his sense of purpose. He had been searching for a familiar landmark, a recognizable face, anything to guide him back to the world he knew. But everything seemed foreign, unfamiliar.\n\nAs he stumbled through the crowded streets, he spotted a small, rundown bar. The sign above the door read \"The Last Chance Saloon.\" John felt an overwhelming urge to enter, to drown his sorrows in a glass of something strong. He pushed open the creaky door and slid onto a stool at the bar.\n\nThe bartender, a gruff old man with a scruffy beard, looked him up and down before nodding and saying, \"What can I get ya?\"\n\nJohn hesitated, unsure of what to say. But then he spotted a bottle of vodka on the shelf behind the bar, half-empty. He pointed to it and croaked, \"Give me that.\"\n\nThe bartender poured him a shot, and John downed it in one gulp. The burning sensation spread through his chest, and he felt a fleeting sense of relief. He ordered another, and another, and another. The vodka seemed to wash away his worries, his fears, his doubts.\n\nAs the night wore on, John began to forget his troubles. He forgot about the lost directions, the unfamiliar streets, the sense of disorientation. He forgot about his name, his job, his life. All that mattered was the vodka, the warmth of the bar, the company of the bartender.\n\nJohn stumbled out of the bar hours later, his head spinning, his body swaying. He had lost track of time, lost track of himself. But for the moment, he didn't care. He had forgotten, and that was all that mattered.\n\nAs he stumbled down the street, he felt a sense of freedom, of release. He had shed his worries, his burdens, his identity. He was just a lost soul, wandering the world, searching for a new direction. And for the moment, that was enough."}

Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films. Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest \u00bb . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer's \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: \"I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.
