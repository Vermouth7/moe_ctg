The problem is asking to create a function that takes a list of elements as input and returns a new list containing only the elements that appear only once in the input list. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order.\n\nHere is the Python function that solves the problem:\n```\ndef unique(l: list):\n    count_dict = {}\n    for i in l:\n        if i in count_dict:\n            count_dict[i] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[i] = 1\n    return [i for i in count_dict if count_dict[i] == 1]\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. We create an empty dictionary `count_dict` to store the count of each element in the input list.\n2. We iterate over the input list `l`. For each element `i`, we check if it's already in the `count_dict`. If it is, we increment its count by 1. If it's not, we add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n3. Finally, we use a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the elements that have a count of 1 in the `count_dict`. This is because these elements appear only once in the input list.\n4. We return the resulting list, which is sorted in ascending order by default.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```\n>>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])\n[0, 2, 9, 123]\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify the 1 added constraint.\n2) Please descriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint# satisfies the 1 added constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 1 element ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies the 1 added constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The added constraint is that the function should return a list with elements that appear only once in the input list, sorted in ascending order.\n\n2) The #Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint# does not satisfy the added constraint because it does not sort the resulting list before returning it.\n\n3) ['NO']"}}]}

You can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in the list, then filter the dictionary to get the elements that appear exactly `n` times.

Then it uses a list comprehension to create a new list with the elements that have a count of `n`. Finally, it sorts this list in ascending order and returns it.\n\nFor example, if you call `unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], 1)`, the function will return `[0, 2, 9, 123]`.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 2 added constraints.\n2) For the 2 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 2 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 2 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 2 added constraints are:\n   - The function should return a list with elements that appear exactly `n` times in the given list.\n   - The returned list should be sorted in ascending order.\n\n2) Discrimination of the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 2 constraints# against each constraint:\n   - For the first constraint, the answer correctly implements the logic to filter elements that appear exactly `n` times in the list.\n   - For the second constraint, the answer correctly sorts the resulting list in ascending order before returning it.\n\n3) ['YES', 'YES']"}}]}

While working from home can be comfortable and convenient, it can also be challenging to stay focused and productive. Here are some tips to help you boost your productivity while working from home:\n\n1. **Create a dedicated workspace**: Designate a specific area of your home as your workspace and keep it organized and clutter-free. This will help you establish a clear boundary between work and personal life.\n2. **Establish a routine**: Set a regular schedule and stick to it. This will help you stay focused and avoid procrastination. Try to maintain a consistent routine, including regular breaks and time for exercise or stretching.\n3. **Minimize distractions**: Eliminate or minimize distractions in your home, such as turning off notifications on your phone, closing social media tabs, and finding a quiet space away from family members or roommates.\n4. **Use productivity tools**: Utilize tools like project management software, time tracking apps, and browser extensions to help you stay organized and focused.\n5. **Take breaks**: Working long hours without taking breaks can lead to burnout. Take short breaks every hour to stretch, move around, and refresh your mind.\n6. **Stay connected with colleagues and friends**: When you're working from home, it can be easy to feel isolated. Schedule regular video calls or virtual coffee breaks with colleagues and friends to stay connected and avoid feelings of loneliness.\n7. **Prioritize self-care**: Working from home can be isolating, which can negatively impact your mental and physical health. Make time for self-care activities, such as meditation, exercise, or reading.\n8. **Set boundaries with family and friends**: Communicate your work hours and boundaries with family and friends to ensure they understand when you are available and when you need to focus on work.\n9. **Stay hydrated and energized**: Drink plenty of water and eat nutritious food to maintain your energy levels. Avoid consuming too much caffeine or sugary snacks, which can lead to energy crashes later.\n10. **Establish a \"shutdown\" routine**: When your workday is over, establish a routine to signal the end of work, such as closing your laptop, taking a short walk, or doing a quick meditation.\n11. **Stay organized**: Keep your digital and physical files organized, and use tools like to-do lists or calendars to stay on top of tasks and deadlines.\n12. **Take care of your physical health**: Working from home can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. Make time for physical activity, such as yoga, stretching, or a quick workout during breaks.\n13. **Limit multitasking**: While it's tempting to do multiple things at once, try to focus on one task at a time. Multitasking can lead to distractions and decreased productivity.\n14. **Use the Pomodoro Technique**: Work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. This technique can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.\n15. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your productivity and adjust your routine as needed. Identify what's working for you and what areas need improvement.\n\nBy implementing these tips, you can increase your productivity while working from home and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Remember to be patient and flexible, as it may take some time to find the right routine that works for you.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify the 1 added constraint.\n2) Please descriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint# satisfies the 1 added constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 1 element ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies the 1 added constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The added constraint is: \"Make sure your response carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.\"\n\n2) The answer provides a comprehensive list of tips and strategies for increasing productivity while working from home, addressing various aspects such as workspace organization, routine establishment, minimizing distractions, and self-care.

It's great that you're looking for ways to increase your productivity while balancing your work and family responsibilities. Here are some tips to help you stay focused and productive while working from home with a small child:\n\n1. **Create a dedicated workspace**: Designate a specific area of your home as your workspace and keep it organized and clutter-free. This will help you establish a clear boundary between work and personal life.\n2. **Establish a routine**: Create a schedule for your workday and stick to it. This will help you stay focused and ensure that you're getting enough time to work. You can also schedule breaks to spend time with your child.\n3. **Use childcare support**: If possible, consider hiring a babysitter or asking a family member to watch your child for a few hours a day. This will give you uninterrupted time to focus on your work.\n4. **Use childcare-friendly work tools**: Look for tools and apps that can help you work with your child nearby. For example, you can use video conferencing software to attend virtual meetings while your child plays nearby.\n5. **Take advantage of naptime**: If your child still takes naps, use this time to focus on your most important tasks. You can also use this time to make phone calls, respond to emails, or do other tasks that require concentration.\n6. **Use the Pomodoro Technique**: Work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. This technique can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.\n7. **Communicate with your employer**: Be open with your employer about your work-from-home setup and any challenges you're facing. They may be able to offer additional support or accommodations to help you stay productive.\n8. **Prioritize self-care**: Working from home with a small child can be stressful and isolating. Make sure to take breaks to stretch, move around, and practice self-care activities like meditation or deep breathing exercises.\n9. **Set boundaries with your child**: Establish clear boundaries with your child about when you're available to play or attend to their needs. This will help them understand when you're working and when you're not.\n10. **Be flexible**: Things won't always go as planned, and that's okay. Be prepared to adjust your schedule or work arrangements as needed to accommodate your child's needs.\n\nAdditional tips for specific scenarios:\n\n* **When your child is very young (0-3 years old)**: Consider using a baby monitor or hiring a babysitter to watch your child while you work. You can also use this time to do tasks that require less concentration, like data entry or social media management.\n* **When your child is older (4-6 years old)**: You can start to involve your child in your work more, such as helping with simple tasks or participating in video conferencing calls. This can help them feel more included and develop important skills like communication and teamwork.\n* **When your child is very active or energetic**: Consider using a playpen or play area to keep your child occupied while you work. You can also use this time to do tasks that require less concentration, like making phone calls or responding to emails.\n\nRemember, working from home with a small child requires flexibility, creativity, and patience. By establishing a routine, using childcare-friendly tools, and prioritizing self-care, you can stay productive and successful while still being present for your child.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 2 added constraints.\n2) For the 2 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 2 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 2 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 2 added constraints are:\n   - Since the pandemic began, I've been working remotely.\n   - I have a small child at home.\n\n2) \n   - The answer satisfies the first constraint (\"Since the pandemic began, I've been working remotely\") by providing tips relevant to working from home during the pandemic.\n   - The answer satisfies the second constraint (\"I have a small child at home\") by offering specific strategies for increasing productivity while managing the responsibilities of having a small child at home.\n\n3) ['YES', 'YES']"}}]}

It can be challenging to balance work and childcare responsibilities, especially during sleepless nights and a pandemic. Here are some tips to help you increase your productivity while working from home with a small child:\n\n1. **Create a dedicated workspace**: Designate a specific area of your home as your workspace and keep it organized and clutter-free. This will help you stay focused and avoid distractions.\n2. **Establish a routine**: Establish a daily routine that works for you and your baby. This can include regular feeding times, nap schedules, and work hours. Sticking to a routine can help you stay on track and reduce stress.\n3. **Take breaks**: Working long hours without breaks can lead to burnout. Take short breaks to tend to your baby's needs, such as feeding, changing diapers, or soothing them during teething episodes.\n4. **Use childcare assistance**: If possible, consider enlisting the help of a partner, family member, or friend to watch your baby while you work. This can give you dedicated time to focus on your tasks.\n5. **Prioritize tasks**: Make a to-do list and prioritize tasks based on importance and urgency. Focus on completing the most critical tasks during your most productive hours, and then take breaks to tend to your baby.\n6. **Use technology to your advantage**: Utilize video conferencing tools, project management software, and other digital tools to stay connected with your team and manage your work efficiently.\n7. **Practice self-care**: Working from home can be isolating, and caring for a new baby can be exhausting. Make time for self-care activities, such as exercise, meditation, or reading, to help you recharge.\n8. **Set boundaries**: Establish boundaries with your family and friends to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Communicate your work hours and needs to them, and ask for their support.\n9. **Take advantage of naptime**: Use your baby's naptime to focus on work or other tasks that require your attention. This can be a great opportunity to get things done without interruptions.\n10. **Be flexible**: Be prepared to adjust your schedule as needed. Some days may be more challenging than others, and that's okay. Be flexible and adapt to changing circumstances.\n11. **Use noise-cancelling headphones**: If your baby is fussy or teething, consider using noise-cancelling headphones to help you focus on your work.\n12. **Outsource tasks**: If possible, consider outsourcing tasks that can be delegated, such as household chores or errands, to free up time for work and childcare.\n13. **Stay organized**: Keep your digital and physical files organized, and use tools like calendars and reminders to stay on track.\n14. **Communicate with your team**: Keep your team informed about your work schedule and any challenges you're facing. They may be able to offer support or adjust deadlines to accommodate your needs.\n15. **Reward yourself**: Working from home with a new baby can be challenging. Reward yourself for your hard work and accomplishments, even if it's just a small treat or a relaxing bath.\n\nRemember, it may take some time to find a rhythm that works for you, but with patience, flexibility, and creativity, you can increase your productivity while working from home with a small child.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 4 added constraints.\n2) For the 4 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 4 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 4 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 4 added constraints are:\n   - After giving birth last year, I have a small child at home.\n   - Given the recent sleepless nights due to my baby's teething.\n   - Since the pandemic began, I've been working remotely.\n   - Make sure your response carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.\n\n2) Discrimination of whether the answer satisfies each constraint:\n   - Constraint 1: The answer acknowledges the presence of a small child and the experience of giving birth last year, thus satisfying this constraint.\n   - Constraint 2: The answer discusses the challenges of sleepless nights and teething, addressing this constraint.\n   - Constraint 3: The answer mentions working remotely since the pandemic began, satisfying this constraint.\n   - Constraint 4: The answer provides a comprehensive response that considers all the mentioned scenarios, thus satisfying this constraint.\n\n3) Final output:\n```python\n['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']\n```"}}]}

Make sure your response carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 5 constraints#\nCongratulations on your new role! Improving time management skills is crucial in a fast-paced tech startup environment. Considering your background as an intern and now a full-time software engineer, here are some tips to help you optimize your time management:\n\n1. **Set clear goals and priorities**: As a new team member, it's essential to understand the company's goals, your role, and your responsibilities. Set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for yourself. Prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance.\n2. **Use a task management tool**: Familiarize yourself with the company's task management system, such as Trello, Asana, or Jira. Create a personal task list or board to organize your work, and break down large projects into smaller, manageable tasks.\n3. **Create a schedule**: Plan out your day, week, or month in advance. Set specific times for tasks, meetings, and breaks. Use a calendar app like Google Calendar or Todoist to schedule tasks and set reminders.\n4. **Focus on one task at a time**: Multitasking can be detrimental to productivity. Focus on one task at a time to ensure you complete it efficiently and effectively. Use the Pomodoro Technique: work for 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break, and repeat.\n5. **Estimate task duration**: Accurately estimate the time required for each task. This will help you plan your day and avoid under or overestimating the time needed for a task.\n6. **Communicate with your team and manager**: Keep your team and manager informed about your progress, challenges, and any changes to your schedule. This will help you stay accountable and avoid last-minute surprises.\n7. **Learn to say no**: Don't take on too much at once. Be mindful of your workload and politely decline tasks that may interfere with your priorities or exceed your capacity.\n8. **Take breaks and practice self-care**: Working long hours without breaks can lead to burnout. Take regular breaks to recharge, exercise, and maintain a healthy work-life balance.\n9. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your progress, task list, and schedule. Adjust your approach as needed to stay on track and optimize your time management.\n10. **Seek feedback and guidance**: Ask your manager, colleagues, or mentors for feedback on your time management skills. They may have valuable insights or suggestions to help you improve.\n\nTo specifically address your scenario:\n\n* As a new team member, prioritize building relationships with your colleagues and understanding the company's workflow and culture.\n* Be prepared to adapt to changing priorities and deadlines in a fast-paced startup environment.\n* Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek guidance when needed.\n* Focus on delivering high-quality work and meeting deadlines to establish trust with your team and manager.\n\nRemember, time management is a skill that takes practice, and it's essential to be flexible and adapt to changes in your role and the company.

Make sure your response carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 4 constraints#\nWhat a lovely gesture! Wrapping a book as a gift can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I'm here to guide you through it. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to wrap a book neatly and thoughtfully:\n\n**Materials needed:**\n\n* Gift wrapping paper (choose a design that fits the theme or the birthday person's style)\n* Gift wrapping tape (clear or matching the paper's color)\n* Ribbon or gift tag (optional)\n* Scissors\n* A flat surface to wrap on\n\n**Step 1: Prepare the Book**\n\nBefore wrapping, make sure the book is clean and free of dust. If the book has a dust jacket, you can remove it to make the wrapping process easier. If not, you can wrap the book with the dust jacket on.\n\n**Step 2: Measure the Book**\n\nMeasure the book's dimensions to determine how much wrapping paper you'll need. Measure the book's length, width, and height. You'll need a piece of wrapping paper that's slightly larger than the book's dimensions.\n\n**Step 3: Cut the Wrapping Paper**\n\nCut a piece of wrapping paper to the desired size, leaving a little extra on each side for folding and tucking in. You can use a ruler or a cutting mat to ensure straight cuts.\n\n**Step 4: Place the Book on the Paper**\n\nPosition the book in the center of the wrapping paper, making sure it's aligned with the paper's edges.\n\n**Step 5: Fold and Tuck**\n\nFold one edge of the paper over the book, creating a straight line. Tuck the folded edge under the book, making sure it's even and smooth. Repeat this process with the other edges, folding and tucking each one in turn.\n\n**Step 6: Secure with Tape**\n\nUse gift wrapping tape to secure the paper in place. Apply the tape along the edges, making sure it's not too tight or too loose. You can also use a small piece of tape to hold the paper in place at the top or bottom of the book.\n\n**Step 7: Add a Ribbon or Gift Tag (Optional)**\n\nIf you want to add a personal touch, you can tie a ribbon around the book or attach a gift tag with a message. Make sure the ribbon or tag is not too bulky or distracting from the book's design.\n\n**Step 8: Finish with a Flourish**\n\nOnce the book is wrapped, fluff out any wrinkles or creases in the paper. You can also add a small decorative touch, such as a bookend or a bookmark, to make the gift more special.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use a wrapping paper with a design that complements the book's cover or the birthday person's interests.\n* Add a personalized message or the birthday person's name to the gift tag or wrapping paper.\n* Consider using a reusable cloth wrapping material, such as a scarf or a piece of fabric, for a more eco-friendly option.\n* If you're wrapping a large or heavy book, you may need to use additional support, such as a box or a wrapping board, to prevent the paper from tearing.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll create a beautifully wrapped book that's sure to impress your friend.
